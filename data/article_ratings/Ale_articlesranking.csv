The World Food Programme (WFP) indicates that the attacks by armed groups in Raja town and clashes between Government forces and an armed group were reported in Leer town. WFP is scaling up its efforts to reach food insecure households through the lean season. The agency requires $74 million for the next six months to meet the needs of all refugees in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda.","Despite some recent political progress in South Sudan, a deteriorating food and nutrition situation, economic decline and sporadic violence are continuing to significantly impact the humanitarian needs within the country, the United Nations food relief agency cautioned today. In an update on the regional impact of the crisis in South Sudan, the World Food Programme (WFP) highlighted that reports indicate that attacks by armed groups in Raja town on 15 June resulted in death, destruction of property and displacements. In addition, clashes between Government forces and an armed group were reported in Leer town, Unity state. ""The deteriorating economic conditions, coupled with rising prices of essential commodities, is contributing to rising criminality in most parts of the country,"" WFP said in the update. In Sudan and Uganda, the rate of new arrivals has slowed compared with previous months, according to the update. WFP noted that it remains to be seen whether the numbers will increase given the deteriorating food security conditions in South Sudan. In that regard, WFP indicated that food insecurity remains a key concern throughout the country. ""The economic decline and high inflation combined with disrupted harvests and livelihoods continue to worsen the food security situation,"" the agency said, noting that Eastern Equatoria, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Western Bahr el Ghazal are exhibiting the most rapid decline in that regard. WFP said it is scaling up its efforts to reach food insecure households through the lean season to prevent a further decline in the food security and nutritional status of the population. General food distributions are ongoing alongside food assistance for assets programmes in Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Eastern Equatoria. The agency said it requires $74 million for the next six months to meet the needs of all refugees in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Food stocks are stretched and immediate funds are required in particular for Sudan and Uganda. In addition to providing food assistance inside South Sudan, WFP provides food assistance for refugees at border crossings, during transit, at reception centres and upon settlement in the camps. Nutrition interventions are ongoing to treat and prevent malnutrition for children younger than 5 years old, as well as pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,-1,-1

Non-governmental organizations and UN agencies are providing life-saving services in the two bases, including water and sanitation, shelter and emergency healthcare to people displaced by the armed violence. Emergency latrines are being dug, high-energy biscuits provided to meet urgent nutritional needs of children and other vulnerable people, and emergency surgical supplies, drugs, and reproductive health kits delivered to hospitals around Juba. Aid agencies have also been able to deliver food to some 7,000 people who have sought shelter in the UN peacekeeping base in Bentiu, Unity State. While assistance is underway in these two cities, I am also concerned about thousands of people affected by the past week's violence in other parts of the country. The situation is particularly bad in Jonglei and Unity states, where fighting has displaced thousands of civilians. I just returned from Bor, where an estimated 17,000 people have sought protection in the UN peacekeeping base. While there, I witnessed firsthand the harrowing results of the intense violence that has swept the area. I heard heartbreaking accounts of people's suffering, including tales of children separated from their parents. Aid workers are also under intense pressure, with humanitarian compounds looted in several locations. We are looking at a massive increase in need and I am engaging all parties to ensure that civilians are protected and that aid workers are able to access people who need our help. Humanitarians will continue to stand by the people of South Sudan at this extremely difficult time and provide impartial and neutral aid to save lives and alleviate suffering. I call on donors to make resources available so that agencies can bring in managers, specialists and supplies without delay.""

"The article discusses the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei regions of Sudan. Despite agreements signed by representatives of the regime committing to a cessation of hostilities, President Omar al-Bashir has made clear that he has no intention of honoring them. The conflict has resulted in displacement, executions of Nuba civilians, and a virtual shutdown of humanitarian access in the region. The article also highlights the historical genocidal jihad directed against the Nuba people in the 1990s and the Khartoum regime's ambitions for depopulating the area of civilians. The international community's failure to acknowledge these ambitions is seen as a reason for the ongoing war. ","What are Khartoum's ambitions in South Kordofan and Abyei? What is the significance of the two agreements concerning these key regions signed by representatives of the regime? The agreement on South Kordofan (and Blue Nile) declared that in principle Khartoum was committed to a cessation of hostilities agreement. But Reuters reports today that on his return from China, President Omar al-Bashir made clear that this is yet another agreement signed expediently and one that he has no intention of honoring (one must surmise that the Chinese have done little to pressure al-Bashir and the regime to come to some reasonable diplomatic settlement). In the ""Framework Agreement ""on South Kordofan and Blue Nile (June 28), Nafi'e Ali Nafi'e---the increasingly powerful senior figure within the National Islamic Front/National Congress Party---officially committed the regime ""to work to agree both [sic] immediate and sustainable security arrangements for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile,"" specifically an ""Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities in Southern Kordofan."" But today we heard a rather different commitment: ""Sudan's President OmarHassan al-Bashir said the army would continue its campaign in the flashpoint of South Kordofan, state news agency SUNA said on Friday, dashing hope of a cease-fire ahead of southern secession. In his first comments since returning from a visit to China, Bashir seemed to contradict comments by a northern official this week that north and south had agreed 'in principle' on a cease-fire in the northern oil state."" ""'He directed the armed forces to continue their military operations in South Kordofan until a cleansing of the region is over,' SUNA quoted Bashir as telling worshippers during Friday prayers."" (dateline: Khartoum) http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE7605O720110701 Celebration of the agreement by the AU's expedient Thabo Mbeki and the UN's feckless Ban Ki-Moon would seem distinctly premature. And in the absence of a cessation of hostilities agreement, we must ask what this war will look like going forward. Despite continuing agnosticism on the part of U.S. special envoy Princeton Lyman about what is occurring in South Kordofan, the images of aerial destruction continue to pour out of the region, as do reports of house-to-house arrests and executions of Nuba civilians; a virtual shutdown of humanitarian access in the region; a massive build-up of weapons and armor in Kadugli (capital of South Kordofan); and relentless aerial assaults on civilians, humanitarians, churches, and other non-military targets in the Nuba Mountains. The results of the present campaign have been horrific. I have assembled an album of my own photographs from 2003, a time of relative peace in the Nuba, and photographs from this past month (June 2011), mainly from Nuba sources. The latter are images of the waral-Bashir vows to continue until the Nuba Mountains have been ""cleansed."" (Warning: many of the photographs are disturbingly gruesome---http://goo.gl/5gDpV) I have also assembled a range of photographs, from various sources, that chronicle the displacement from Abyei of the Dinka Ngok to the South, the destruction and looting of Abyei town, as well as the plight of those displaced to Akok, Turelei, Wau, and other Southern towns. As Sudan moves into the heaviest part of the rainy season, water-borne diseases will become increasingly frequent and dangerous. A normally optimistic program director for a Western humanitarian organization, with a long history in this area, informs me that he sees only a very grim future for these people---http://goo.gl/oAhxE A great deal of this has been eminently foreseeable. I argued on March 9, 2011: ""[Khartoum's] military strategy comes ever more clearly into focus: seize Abyei as far south as possible, then negotiate final status of the region from a position of military strength...."" ""If war resumes in Abyei, it is likely to spread quickly to the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan and Southern Blue Nile. The entire North/South border could become one long military front, particularly in the oil regions of Unity State and South Kordofan. Unless Khartoum is sent the clearest possible signal that it will gain nothing by such offensive military action, including arming and encouraging Misseriya militias, the fighting in Abyei will increase. The UN peacekeeping mission (UNMIS) is neither willing nor able to intervene---or even report on what lies beyond their bases. At this point, UNMIS patrols are consistently being denied freedom of movement by both the SAF and SPLA. Heavily armed, Khartoum-backed Misseriya units continue marauding throughout much of Abyei."" (""Obama Weak on the Rapidly Escalating Crisis in Abyei, ""Dissent Magazine (on-line), March 9, 2011 http://dissentmagazine.org/atw.php?id=396) All this has come to pass because the international community, and especially the U.S. as guided by special envoy Lyman, has refused to see Khartoum's ambitions for what they are, refused to assess on a realistic basis what would deter the regime from war-making that even in early March was clearly in the offing. It has also come to pass despite the grim history of the genocidal jihad directed against the Nuba people during the 1990s, a history that should do much more to inform the thinking of special envoy Lyman, who casually declared in response to a question about whether the Nuba Mountains might become a ""new Darfur"": ""I don't think so for two reasons. One because the Nuba Mountain people are fighting back and I don't think the North is capable of dislodging large numbers of people on an ethnic basis from the Nuba Mountains. That's the reality on the ground. Second, I'm not sure that's the objective of the government though local commanders may have a different point of view."" But of course the Nuba people ""fought back"" heroically in the 1990s; even so, hundreds of thousands died (mostly from starvation and disease) and hundreds of thousands were displaced from the irrich farmlands. History flatly contradicts Lyman's claim. And as to Lyman's surmise about the ""objectives"" of the Khartoum regime, this seems absurdly complacent, given the history of this regime. The evidence of ethnic targeting of Nuba civilians for execution and aerial attack is overwhelming. Lyman would do well to read an account by Alex de Waal of the ghastly history of genocide in the Nuba Mountains in the 1990s (""Averting Genocide in the NubaMountains,""2006) ""The counterinsurgency fought by the Government of Sudan against the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in the Nuba Mountains of central Sudan during the early1990s was not only exceptionally violent, but also aimed at depopulating the area of civilians. Not only did the government aim to defeat the SPLA forces but they also intended a wholesale transformation of Nuba society in such a way that its prior identity was destroyed. The campaign was genocidal in intent and at one point, appeared to be on the brink of success...."" ""The war was notable for attacks on civilian targets with forced displacement, rape and killing. The principal instruments of counterinsurgency included locally-recruited militia, the regular army and the air force, under the overall coordination of Military Intelligence...."" ""The early period of the war was marked by militia massacres and extra-judicial executions by military intelligence. In a mixture of reprisals and counter-insurgency, some of it pre-emptive, a coalition of military officers and local militia commanders escalated violence against the Nuba. The first step was the arming of local Arab tribes by the government, initially as a panicked response to an SPLA attack in the region in 1985, and in 1989 they were formalized into the 'Popular Defence Forces.' The militias committed the worst massacres of the war, driven not only by orders from their paramilitary command, but also by their own search for cattle, loot and cheap labor...."" ""Death squads targeted community leaders in rural areas, while intellectuals in the towns were rounded up by Military Intelligence and 'disappeared.' The rationale was explained by Khalid Abdel Karim al Husseini, formerly head of the security in the Office of the Governor of Kordofan (and younger brother of the governor), until he left Sudan and sought asylum in Europe in 1993. He said that the government was 'taking the intellectuals, taking the professionals, to ensure that the Nuba were so primitive that they couldn't speak for themselves.'"" All of this---all of it---is again evident in the conduct of counter-insurgency war: the extra-judicial executions; the targeting of intellectuals and indeed all Nuba; the arming of Arab militias and the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), the latter now entirely Arab; the depopulating of the Nuba Mountains; the campaign to deny food and humanitarian assistance. And as the Small Arms Survey makes clear in its report on arms in South Kordofan (""Armed Entities in South Kordofan,"" June 2011), the Khartoum-allied militia groups are extremely heavily armed and supplied---this in addition to the growing SAF military presence from Dilling to Kadugli.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,-1,0

In the ""Framework Agreement ""on South Kordofan and Blue Nile (June 28), Nafi'e Ali Nafi'e---the increasingly powerful senior figure within the National Islamic Front/National Congress Party---officially committed the regime ""to work to agree both [sic] immediate and sustainable security arrangements for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile,"" specifically an ""Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities in Southern Kordofan."" But today we heard a rather different commitment: ""Sudan's President OmarHassan al-Bashir said the army would continue its campaign in the flashpoint of South Kordofan, state news agency SUNA said on Friday, dashing hope of a cease-fire ahead of southern secession. In his first comments since returning from a visit to China, Bashir seemed to contradict comments by a northern official this week that north and south had agreed 'in principle' on a cease-fire in the northern oil state."" ""'He directed the armed forces to continue their military operations in South Kordofan until a cleansing of the region is over,' SUNA quoted Bashir as telling worshippers during Friday prayers."" (dateline: Khartoum) http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE7605O720110701 Celebration of the agreement by the AU's expedient Thabo Mbeki and the UN's feckless Ban Ki-Moon would seem distinctly premature. And in the absence of a cessation of hostilities agreement, we must ask what this war will look like going forward. Despite continuing agnosticism on the part of U.S. special envoy Princeton Lyman about what is occurring in South Kordofan, the images of aerial destruction continue to pour out of the region, as do reports of house-to-house arrests and executions of Nuba civilians; a virtual shutdown of humanitarian access in the region; a massive build-up of weapons and armor in Kadugli (capital of South Kordofan); and relentless aerial assaults on civilians, humanitarians, churches, and other non-military targets in the Nuba Mountains. The results of the present campaign have been horrific. I have assembled an album of my own photographs from 2003, a time of relative peace in the Nuba, and photographs from this past month (June 2011), mainly from Nuba sources. The latter are images of the waral-Bashir vows to continue until the Nuba Mountains have been ""cleansed."" (Warning: many of the photographs are disturbingly gruesome---http://goo.gl/5gDpV) I have also assembled a range of photographs, from various sources, that chronicle the displacement from Abyei of the Dinka Ngok to the South, the destruction and looting of Abyei town, as well as the plight of those displaced to Akok, Turelei, Wau, and other Southern towns. As Sudan moves into the heaviest part of the rainy season, water-borne diseases will become increasingly frequent and dangerous. A normally optimistic program director for a Western humanitarian organization, with a long history in this area, informs me that he sees only a very grim future for these people---http://goo.gl/oAhxE A great deal of this has been eminently foreseeable. I argued on March 9, 2011: ""[Khartoum's] military strategy comes ever more clearly into focus: seize Abyei as far south as possible, then negotiate final status of the region from a position of military strength...."" ""If war resumes in Abyei, it is likely to spread quickly to the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan and Southern Blue Nile. The entire North/South border could become one long military front, particularly in the oil regions of Unity State and South Kordofan. Unless Khartoum is sent the clearest possible signal that it will gain nothing by such offensive military action, including arming and encouraging Misseriya militias, the fighting in Abyei will increase. The UN peacekeeping mission (UNMIS) is neither willing nor able to intervene---or even report on what lies beyond their bases. At this point, UNMIS patrols are consistently being denied freedom of movement by both the SAF and SPLA. Heavily armed, Khartoum-backed Misseriya units continue marauding throughout much of Abyei."" (""Obama Weak on the Rapidly Escalating Crisis in Abyei, ""Dissent Magazine (on-line), March 9, 2011 http://dissentmagazine.org/atw.php?id=396) All this has come to pass because the international community, and especially the U.S. as guided by special envoy Lyman, has refused to see Khartoum's ambitions for what they are, refused to assess on a realistic basis what would deter the regime from war-making that even in early March was clearly in the offing. It has also come to pass despite the grim history of the genocidal jihad directed against the Nuba people during the 1990s, a history that should do much more to inform the thinking of special envoy Lyman, who casually declared in response to a question about whether the Nuba Mountains might become a ""new Darfur"": ""I don't think so for two reasons. One because the Nuba Mountain people are fighting back and I don't think the North is capable of dislodging large numbers of people on an ethnic basis from the Nuba Mountains. That's the reality on the ground. Second, I'm not sure that's the objective of the government though local commanders may have a different point of view."" But of course the Nuba people ""fought back"" heroically in the 1990s; even so, hundreds of thousands died (mostly from starvation and disease) and hundreds of thousands were displaced from the irrich farmlands. History flatly contradicts Lyman's claim. And as to Lyman's surmise about the ""objectives"" of the Khartoum regime, this seems absurdly complacent, given the history of this regime. The evidence of ethnic targeting of Nuba civilians for execution and aerial attack is overwhelming. Lyman would do well to read an account by Alex de Waal of the ghastly history of genocide in the Nuba Mountains in the 1990s (""Averting Genocide in the NubaMountains,""2006) ""The counterinsurgency fought by the Government of Sudan against the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in the Nuba Mountains of central Sudan during the early1990s was not only exceptionally violent, but also aimed at depopulating the area of civilians. Not only did the government aim to defeat the SPLA forces but they also intended a wholesale transformation of Nuba society in such a way that its prior identity was destroyed. The campaign was genocidal in intent and at one point, appeared to be on the brink of success...."" ""The war was notable for attacks on civilian targets with forced displacement, rape and killing. The principal instruments of counterinsurgency included locally-recruited militia, the regular army and the air force, under the overall coordination of Military Intelligence...."" ""The early period of the war was marked by militia massacres and extra-judicial executions by military intelligence. In a mixture of reprisals and counter-insurgency, some of it pre-emptive, a coalition of military officers and local militia commanders escalated violence against the Nuba. The first step was the arming of local Arab tribes by the government, initially as a panicked response to an SPLA attack in the region in 1985, and in 1989 they were formalized into the 'Popular Defence Forces.' The militias committed the worst massacres of the war, driven not only by orders from their paramilitary command, but also by their own search for cattle, loot and cheap labor...."" ""Death squads targeted community leaders in rural areas, while intellectuals in the towns were rounded up by Military Intelligence and 'disappeared.' The rationale was explained by Khalid Abdel Karim al Husseini, formerly head of the security in the Office of the Governor of Kordofan (and younger brother of the governor), until he left Sudan and sought asylum in Europe in 1993. He said that the government was 'taking the intellectuals, taking the professionals, to ensure that the Nuba were so primitive that they couldn't speak for themselves.'"" All of this---all of it---is again evident in the conduct of counter-insurgency war: the extra-judicial executions; the targeting of intellectuals and indeed all Nuba; the arming of Arab militias and the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), the latter now entirely Arab; the depopulating of the Nuba Mountains; the campaign to deny food and humanitarian assistance. And as the Small Arms Survey makes clear in its report on arms in South Kordofan (""Armed Entities in South Kordofan,"" June 2011), the Khartoum-allied militia groups are extremely heavily armed and supplied---this in addition to the growing SAF military presence from Dilling to Kadugli.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,humanitarian,-1,0

According to a press release issued by the UN Mission in South Sudan earlier this morning, the fighting erupted on Friday, 8 May following a domestic dispute and steadily degenerated into a series of clashes between individuals wielding machetes, sticks and metal bars that continued throughout the weekend despite repeated interventions by UN peacekeepers. One person was killed during the violence on Sunday and about 60 more were injured in the disturbances, which also provoked the departure of an estimated 3,500 IDPs from the protection sites. The Mission noted that it had sought assurances from South Sudanese authorities about the safety and well-being of the IDPs who left the Mission's protection sites earlier this week, adding that ""the primary responsibility for the protection of civilians continues to lie with the government of the Republic of South Sudan."" In addition, the Mission reiterated its ""long-standing policy"" that all departures from UNMISS protection sites are done so on ""a strictly voluntary basis,"" and that it does not prevent IDPs from leaving its premises if that is their preference. In the meantime, the Mission said, it is engaging with community leaders in the Juba PoC sites to defuse the situation and avert a recurrence of the disturbances of this past weekend. South Sudan has been in the grip of conflict since December 2013 - a conflict marked by brutal violence against civilians and deepening suffering across the country. The major humanitarian consequences are widespread displacement due to the violence, including high rates of death, disease, and injuries, severe food insecurity and disrupted livelihoods, and a major malnutrition crisis. Some 119,000 people are sheltered in UNMISS compounds across the country while the Organization estimates that the number of people in need for 2015 will include an anticipated 1.95 million IDPs and a projected 293,000 refugees. Last weekend's violence in Juba coincides with a deterioration of the security situation in South Sudan's northern Unity State. A series of ""continuing and consistent reports"" indicate, in fact, a surge in kidnappings and rapes and an overall uptick in violence, which has forced the UN and other aid agencies to withdraw staff from the region. Addressing reporters at today's press briefing in Geneva, spokesman for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Rupert Colville, said his office remained ""deeply concerned about the escalation of fighting in the strategic, oil-rich Unity State"" and cited reports of killings, rape, abduction and looting of cattle and other property. Mr. Colville explained that thousands of civilians have fled the attacks - with at least 2,200 new arrivals seeking refuge at UNMISS' PoC site in Bentiu as of 10 May, while others had fled or are in bushes between villages south of Nhialdiu and Koch, and Leer. According to interviews with civilians who managed to flee, he added, perpetrators of these atrocities are Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) soldiers and armed youth. There are also mobilized youth reportedly clad in civilian clothes and wielding AK47s. ""Ahead of the rainy season, when people are planting crops, we urge absolute restraint by the parties to the conflict,"" Mr. Colville concluded. ""Attacks on civilian lives and infrastructure amount to clear violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law and must be investigated.""",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,humanitarian,-1,-1
"The article discusses the ongoing tensions between Sudan and South Sudan, with Sudan displaying aggression towards South Sudan despite the latter's willingness to participate in negotiations. The article highlights the issue of slavery of South Sudanese citizens by Arabs in Sudan, as well as the fact that Sudan is hindering progress towards resolution of conflicts and peaceful coexistence between the two nations. Specific locations mentioned include Unity State, Upper Nile State, Addis Ababa, Abyei, Kafia Kingi, and Hofrat As-Nahas.","The Republic of South Sudan since it became independent on 9th July, 2011 had been always respecting international conventions and charters enacted by the international community at the United Nations or other recognized bodies. One of the charters is the respect of sovereignty and integrity of another nation and contributing to maintenance of international and regional stability, cooperation and progress. It is on this basis that despite the belligerence and bellicosity demonstrated by Sudan in its relations with South Sudan, the country is ever willing to participate in negotiation with it. Unfortunately getting to the negotiation table seems to rekindle for the Sudan the old mentality that South Sudan despite it being in equal footing with Khartoum to be an inferior nation which is not in calibre with it to sit and talk as equal. To prove that the awkward Sudanese mentality is even taken note of by the US the superpower had recently told the Sudan to respect the independence and sovereignty of South Sudan and to live with it as a neighbour in peace. A few days ago as delegations from Khartoum and Juba headed to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital for further talks to ease the impasse over the oil crisis and other issues, the Sudan in bad faith bombed towns and villages in Unity and Upper Nile States. Earlier its jet fighter threw six bombs in the oil fields aimed at destroying the wells. Just hours before the talks with Juba the leaderships in Khartoum announced the closure of its border with the South to prevent any goods coming across. In the talks the crucial issue of over 30,000 South Sudanese kept by Arabs in Sudan as slaves was belittled by the chief negotiator for Khartoum dismissing the existence of slaves in his country. Yet even President Al Bashir has several Southern slaves in his household let alone NCP officials like Nafie Ali Nafie and the defence minister Abdel Rahim who have several slaves from South Sudan in their households. The Sudanese are always working against any understanding as if it is South Sudan only to benefit from such agreements. Well it is true the border between the two countries has not been demarcated and if that can be done South Sudan will only expect from Sudan good neighbourliness and if there is no trade the South shares borders with Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo DRC and Central African Republic. It can always trade with all or any of these countries and get goods which its citizens need. Sudan can keep its products. If Sudan can give back all the lands due to South Sudan, territories like Abyei, Kafia Kingi and Hofrat As-Nahas , the South Sudan will not bother Sudan and the two nations can coexist as neighbours. It is this necessity that there is need to keep talking. Sudan must not misunderstand the reasons why the South is ever ready to go for talks. It is just to enable it secure what are due to it like its citizens who number over 30,000 who are kept as slaves by the Arabs in Sudan and those areas still kept by Sudan from where they take more slaves. It is all these concerns of South Sudan that it is ever willing to discuss with Sudan. But unfortunately Sudan since its creation throughout its life as a nation had been unwisely stubborn, belligerent, warmonger, a thief, a deceit, a liar, a terrorist and slave owner. Unless it changes its bad character it will one day find that it is abandoned not only by AU but other world bodies which cannot stomach its evil character. Sudan must change its bad character otherwise all the peace-loving nations should isolate it and only resume relations when its manners are compatible to international norms.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,conflict,-1,-1
"The article discusses inter-communal violence between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribesmen in multiple locations in South Sudan, including Pibor County and Twic East's Pakeer Payam. The violence has resulted in hundreds of deaths and displacements. SSANSA calls for an immediate dialogue between the groups involved and recommends that the government puts in place a transitional justice mechanism.","Juba — Lou Nuer and Murle tribesmen involved in inter-communal violence should cease hostilities and begin immediate dialogue, SSANSA said today. SSANSA further condemns all acts of violence as a means of solving inter-communal disputes. The repeated failure of both the South Sudan Army and UNMISS peace keeping forceto protect unarmed civilians from hostilities demonstrates that more efforts needs to be directed to preventing the cycleof violence rather than focussing exclusively or more on the mitigation of the impacts. In the past few weeks, large scale inter-communal violence resumed between the Lou Nuer and the Murle tribesmen in Pibor when over 6000 gun wielding youth from Lou Nuer youth marched to Murle settlements in Pibor County. This latest attacks left over 400 people dead on each side, some over 300 wounded and further displacements besides the already tens of thousands of people forced to flee their homes due to fighting between rebels and government forces in the county. Speaking to some youth injured in the violence, SSANSA established that the latest attack by the Lou Nuer in Pibor was revenge to earlier attacks believed to be carried out by armed groups belonging to the Murle tribe. Yet, the fighting between the government and fighters loyal to David Yau Yau has already left many families in Murle settlements of Pibor to flee their homes. SSANSA's concern is, the violence is increasingly intertwining with the hostilities of the rebel group led by David Yau Yau which is purely political. This makes the already poor security situation worse, tribal rivalries entrenched and efforts to address the conflict even more complex. ""It is high time the Lou Nuer and Murle communities involved in continuous violence against each other came to terms with the fact that ""an eye for an eye"" is an irrelevant and costly attempt that will not solve their conflicts. Both communities can bear witnesses to their own actions that revenge only breeds more revenge. Only dialogue can find genuine solutions to their disputes."" Said, Geoffrey L. Duke, National Coordinator of SSANSA. Although in lesser scale, related attacks continue in Jonglei State. The attack of August 8, 2013 in Twic East's Pakeer Payam left 9 men dead and 5 injured, further leaving over 9000 heads of cattle lost, was carried out by members of the Murle tribe. Whether criminal, political or revenge for the latest inter-communal attack, these attacks illustrates the continuation of a cycle of tribal-related violence in the state. We are concerned that the continuation further promotes human rights violations and risks worsening the humanitarian situation in the state. ""The human right violations, humanitarian situation and the resultant human suffering are indeed appalling. However,the priority here is clear; the indispensible need to end the violence. This is essential for prevention of further violation of human rights, providing the context for restoration of the rule of law and provision of the badly needed humanitarian support to the tens of thousands of people in need in Jonglei state."" Said by Mr. Lony Ruot of Standard Action Liaison Focus (SALF), a member of SSANSA operating in Jonglei State. SSANSA therefore wants to make the following recommendations: 1. We call on religious leaders and UNMISS to offer an opportunity to facilitate an immediate peace dialogue between the Lou Nuer and the Murle including the Dinka tribesmen involved in the conflict. We are aware that the National Peace and Reconciliation committee has a wider national mandate, but urge the committee to direct urgent priority efforts to resolving the conflict between the Lou Nuer and the Murle, to particularly prevent the awful cycle of violence. 2. We further call for an immediate dialogue between the government of South Sudan and rebel leader David Yau Yau. We would like to remind both parties that the current military approach to reform and violent reactions are not only costly for civilians caught in between but cannot achieve sustainable solutions to the problem the parties seek to solve. We further call on religious leaders to take the lead in brokering the dialogue and UNMISS and other international community to provide the support needed to facilitate the proposed community dialogues. 3. We urge the government to put in place a transitional justice mechanism to prevent the parties involved from resorting to revenge, justified as a means of justice and to bring the perpetrators of violence (independent of their affiliation) to justice without delay.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,conflict,-1,-1
"The article discusses the potential for full-scale war between north and south Sudan due to border clashes. The points of contention between the two include the status of the Abyei region, fighting in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile regions, disputes over oil revenues, and issues related to citizenship.","A senior UN human rights official has warned that full-scale war between north and south Sudan will break out if border clashes escalate. As southern Sudan heads for formal independence on 9 July, we look at the points of contention between north and south.Abyei Abyei, an area of 10,460 square kilometres, was a major battleground between north and south. Its status was left undecided in the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement that ended a 21-year war in which 2 million people were killed. A referendum, due in January, on whether the area should be part of the north or south was postponed indefinitely because of disagreement over who was eligible to vote. Abyei became a flashpoint last month, when a clash started by southern forces gave the north a pretext to seize the area in breach of existing agreements. Tens of thousands fled amid reports of looting and burning. On 27 June, the UN security council approved the deployment of 4,200 Ethiopian peacekeepers for six months, only a week after the north and south had signed an agreement to demilitarise Abyei. This means there will be up to four separate peacekeeping forces in Sudan - one in Abyei, a joint UN-African Union body in Darfur, a force that monitors compliance with the 2005 peace deal, and a new unit for the soon-to-be-independent south. The International Crisis Group says the dispute pits southern-aligned Ngok Dinka communities who live in the area against nomadic Misseriya Arabs who migrate through the territory to graze huge cattle herds during the dry season. The two communities have lived in relative peace but uncertainty over the territory's future has fuelled fears among its communities. The Ngok Dinkas overwhelmingly favour joining the south, while Misseriya communities fear annexation could prevent migration and thus threaten their way of life. Southern Kordofan At least 73,000 people are estimated to have been displaced in recent weeks due to fighting between northern and southern forces, although this week the warring factions reached an agreement on political and security arrangements for Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, two states along the country's border. Southern Kordofan has the most productive oil fields that will be left in the north after the split, which could see Khartoum lose up to 75% of Sudan's 500,000 barrels per day of oil output. Fighting broke out in the region when Sudanese government troops and militia sought to disarm Nuba fighters, many of whom fought alongside the southern rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The 2005 peace deal left the Nubas in a political limbo, denying them self-rule and, crucially, not specifying what would happen to the 30,000-strong Nuba rebel army enrolled in the SPLA. Pro-southern groups were ordered to disarm after Ahmed Haroun - who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed in Darfur - was declared the winner of recent governorship elections. The south says the Nuba fighters are not theirs and that it cannot ask them to withdraw from the south because they are northern. ""There is no relation between the government in Juba and the SPLA in the Nuba mountains or anywhere in the north,"" SPLA spokesman Philip Aguer told Reuters. ""If the north attacks them, it will be another situation like Darfur, with the north attacking their own people."" The attacks have been strongly condemned by the UN and the Foreign Office. Oil revenues South Sudan contains around 75% of Sudan's total production of oil, but north Sudan owns most of the oil refineries, the pipeline and the ports from where the oil would be shipped. The 2005 peace agreement stipulates that north Sudan shares 50% of the oil revenues produced in south Sudan, but no deal has been reached. President Omar al-Bashir has threatened to shut pipelines carrying south Sudan's oil if no agreement is reached before southern independence. He said either the south could continue to hand over half its oil revenue to the north, or it could pay for using the north's oil infrastructure. The south has broached the idea of a new pipeline through Kenya or Uganda, but this would take several years. The southern government is almost totally dependent on oil revenue so if Bashir carries out any of his threats, the south - already one of the world's poorest regions - woud be hard hit. Citizenship More southerners live in the north than the reverse. The north has indicated that southerners will be free to work (except in government jobs), live and travel in the north, without being citizens. But both sides appear to reject dual citizenship and it will be important to ensure that the transition period is sufficiently long to avoid individuals becoming stateless, said experts in a parliamentary report.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,conflict,0,-1

Some of the most affected locations include North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur in Sudan, Upper Nile in South Sudan, Mogadishu in Somalia, and Yemen. The conflicts have displaced millions of people and hindered humanitarian efforts due to government opposition and rebel control. Famine and bankruptcy are rising concerns in South Sudan, whereas Yemen faces a severe humanitarian crisis due to the Houthi rebellion and dependency on oil supplies.","London — The wars in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine are getting wide coverage in Western media, but there are at least 30 other conflicts in the world that are likely to go largely unnoticed this year and keep millions of people in crisis. Here are a few of them: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO Fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo's east displaced 770,000 people in 2014 alone. Overall 2.7 million people are displaced within Congo. Civil war ended for much of the country with a 2002 peace deal, but the fighting continues in the eastern provinces. People live in fear of being attacked by militias and national soldiers. In just one province - North Kivu - there are more than 20 armed groups. An estimated 7 million people across the country need aid, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Elections next year will be pivotal as the violence in the east is largely a symptom of the government's poor governance, says the International Crisis Group (ICG). SUDAN The civil war that tore Sudan apart, leading to the formation of South Sudan in 2011, did not end after a 2005 peace deal. Fighting continues in western Darfur region, and the southern states bordering South Sudan. The conflict in Darfur used to be primarily between rebels and government forces but has now fragmented, and rebels are fighting each other as well as government forces. In Darfur, more than 450,000 people fled their homes in 2014, most of them moving to overcrowded displacement camps hosting some 2 million people. The government restricts the access and movement of aid agencies and U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur, and has pressured the U.N. to reduce its force protecting civilians there, despite a surge in violence. In South Kordofan and Blue Nile states in the south, hundreds of thousands of people in opposition-held areas are cut off from aid because of government operations against rebels. SOUTH SUDAN Civil war here is entering its second year, bringing the country to the brink of bankruptcy and famine. Despite ceasefires, the violence displaced 1.9 million people in 2014. Fighting has worsened people's ability to grow or buy food in parts of South Sudan, with aid agencies warning of famine in 2015. Cereal prices in conflict-affected Upper Nile state are three to four times higher than in the rest of the country. In December, many displaced families and their hosts ran out of food, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) said. More than 4 million people will need aid to survive in 2015, OCHA says. The government has brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy to pay for the war, according to ICG. SOMALIA Although civil war here has eased a little, it has not ended. African Union peacekeepers and the Somali army last year forced al Shabaab rebels out of their strongholds in central and southern Somalia. However, the rebels still control many rural areas and carry out attacks on the capital Mogadishu and other towns, as well as semi-autonomous regions in the north. For the first time since the end of the devastating 2011 famine, the humanitarian situation deteriorated last year. More than 3 million people, out of a population of 9.8 million, urgently need aid in what is one of the most dangerous places for aid agencies to operate. Funding shortages meant U.N. agencies had to scale down or stop providing food and healthcare. UNICEF stopped primary healthcare services for 2.5 million people in southern and central Somalia. YEMEN The most impoverished country in the Middle East faces an uncertain 2015. Clashes between Houthi rebels and presidential guards have prompted the president and government to resign. The Houthis swept into the capital in September last year and are now the dominant force in the country. Yemen is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis, affecting more than half the population. It has high levels of unemployment, rapid population growth, diminishing water resources, and is heavily dependent on dwindling oil supplies. Some other countries and regions with conflicts include Central African Republic, Libya, Pakistan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Kashmir, India - with its Naxalite conflict and conflict in Assam state - the North Caucasus region, and Ethiopia's Ogaden region.

Unity State deputy governor Michael Chiengjiek Geay told Sudan Tribune on Wednesday that Ngai's statement is a clear accusation against state governments. Geay dismissed Ngai's claim that the state governments were acting without Juba's consent. In Western Bahr el Ghazal civil servant salaries have been cut since July by up too 50 percent and 25 percent in Unity state. State authorities say the cuts are necessary in the implementation of nationwide austerity measures. Geay claims that his state is facing a SSDG2.2 million [US$500,000] deficit due to cuts from Juba this year. The state previously received SSDG54 million [US$12 million] from central government. South Sudan halted oil production in January in a row with Khartoum over transit fees. As oil makes up the vast majority of South Sudan's revenues, its halting necessitated the implementation of austerity measures. However, agreements signed by both countries in Addis Ababa in September allow for oil production to resume. Geay accused the Ministry of Finance of lacking proper authority to collect revenues. He said the announcement by the Central Equatoria government that it will pullout from centralised tax collection in January 2013 is a result of weak management from the ministry.

South Sudan is currently one of the poorest countries in the world but potentially rich with promising resources such as agriculture and oil, among others. Currently its yearly overall budget is less than 1.5 billion dollars of which 98% comes from its share of 50% from oil revenues. The new independent state will need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in order to connect its territory, which is the size of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania combined with expensive roads and bridges. The region will also build refineries and pipelines to transport its crude oil to the international market. The South also embarks on introducing real estates for decent housing through direct foreign investment in the ten states as well as build hydro electric dam to light the whole region, among many more expensive projects of service delivery to the people. In a press briefing on Wednesday shortly after his arrival to Juba from his three weeks visit to the United States of America during which he mobilized for support for the new independent state, Machar said he participated in the UN's special session of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on South Sudan in New York. ""The main objective in the ECOSOC is to mobilize the world to support South Sudan and Sudan in different areas such as infrastructures, agriculture, rule of law and good governance and etc,"" he stated in a one page press briefing document seen by the Sudan Tribune. Machar said after independence the focus will shift to attracting investments in the new nation. He said he met with a number of key investors during his visit in the US who expressed interest to invest in the region after independence. ""With these visits and many more to come, the focus will be to attract investors to come and invest in South Sudan and we want to build South Sudan to be the best in the region and the world,"" he said. The Vice President expressed optimism that South Sudan would become the ""hub"" of Africa, adding the nation is also geographically the center of the continent. ""70 kilometers away from Juba in Tali, Central Equatoria, this is where the center of Africa is. We will build an airport in South Sudan where South Sudan can be the hub of the African Countries and the world just like Dubai and Singapore."" ""We will raise 500 billion dollars from private investments in the next 5 years to build this nation to catch up with the rest of the world in infrastructure development. There is no reason why we should not be the best of the best in the region and the world. We have resources and we will utilize the resources to benefit our nation,"" he further assured. He described his visit to the US as success during which he held several meetings with officials of the US administration, Congress and the United Nations on issues pertaining to the emerging new nation, the Abyei crisis and the fighting in Nuba Mountains in addition to Blue Nile. ""The conclusion of my visit to USA was a success. Both the Congressional and U.S Government officials expressed their support to the new state and to make this state viable and support it in all areas."" He said he also discussed with the US Congress the need to lift sanctions imposed on Khartoum, particularly on oil sector, arguing that the continuity of the sanctions will not only harm North Sudan but also affect the new state of South Sudan which depends on oil facilities from the North such as the pipelines and refineries as well as the export terminal.

Annual inflation fell from 47.8% in January to just 42.2% in February.

The unexpected decrease, South Sudan National Bureau of Statistic (SSNBS) said, was mainly driven by lower prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. CPI is an index which tracks the price of a representative basket of goods and services consumed by households in South Sudan with the composition of the goods and services in the basket reflecting average household consumption in the country. However, while the change in the CPI over time indicates how much more expensive it is for the average household to continue consuming the same basket of goods and services; the percentage change in the CPI is what determines the consumer price inflation. In its 2 March reportthe statistical body noted that from January to February, the CPI decreased by 0.6% in Juba, the South Sudanese capital, while that in Wau [Western Bahr el Ghazal state] and Malakal [Upper Nile state] declined by 9.3% and 3.1% respectively.

"The article discusses the challenges facing healthcare providers attempting to expand healthcare access in the isolated, mountainous Boma District in Jonglei State, South Sudan. Decades of war, a lack of development, and the fact that only one in four people has access to medical facilities have resulted in some of the world's worst health indicators. The major challenges facing healthcare providers are logistics, security, and the fact that many in Boma are nomadic pastoralists, with low literacy rates making it difficult to recruit local staff.","Boma — Decades of war and a lack of development have left a majority of South Sudan's population without access to any form of healthcare, resulting in some of the world's worst health indicators. In a country where only one in four people has access to medical facilities, virtually everyone qualifies as ""hard to reach"", and those attempting to expand healthcare access face daunting challenges. In the isolated, mountainous Boma District, in Jonglei State, rains cut off vehicular transport for eight months of the year. The only way in is by foot or on a weekly UN flight that takes place only when the rains have let up enough to allow aircraft to land. ""We are working in one of the most difficult environments in one of the most challenging countries in the world. Instead of expecting people to come to us, we reach out to them to give vaccinations, health education, primary health care and referrals,"" said Collins Kyererezi, health agency Merlin's primary healthcare supervisor in Boma. ""The major challenge we are facing is logistics, because from April to December the rains set in and reduce accessibility, with virtually no road access to any of the locations we are serving outside of the town. Maintaining logistical support for the clinics is virtually impossible during the rains, so everything needs to be stockpiled in advance."" Local health workers Only one of the four primary health units Kyererezi supervises is less than a day's walk from the Merlin hospital in Boma. The Merlin clinic at the area of Labarap, for example, is three day's distance away. Anyone requiring hospital treatment during the rains has to be carried on foot. Many in Boma are nomadic pastoralists, whose movements further complicate healthcare access. And security is major a concern. In Jonglei State, violent clashes between various ethnic groups is common. ""For me personally, my greatest concern is supervising the clinics during the wet season due to inaccessibility and banditry - sometimes it is unsafe to walk without [an armed] escort,"" Kyererezi said. Merlin, the only healthcare provider in Boma, works with a team of home-based hygiene promoters who, in addition to providing the population with basic health education and first aid, screen children under age five for malnutrition and refer complex pregnancies to Boma's basic hospital. But low literacy rates in Boma make it difficult to recruit local staff, and qualified staff elsewhere in the country regard the area as a hardship duty station. To meet the gap, Merlin 'mentors' even those with rudimentary English-language skills, providing them with a two-week crash course in the integrated management of childhood illnesses, immunization services, and maternal and child healthcare, according to Kyererezi. This approach has seen about 75 percent of children under five in Boma being reached in routine house-to-house immunization campaigns, well above the national average of 37 percent. With village health workers able to screen for pregnancy complications, about 25 percent of deliveries now take place at Boma Hospital, an improvement over past rates. A 2012 report entitled Women's Security in South Sudan: Threats in the Home by Geneva-based think-tank Small Arms Survey (SAS) states that 90 percent of women in South Sudan give birth away from formal medical facilities and without the help of professionally trained assistants. Helping women Sarah Kasoga, a doctor from Uganda who has been working in Boma for the past eight months, attributed some of the health problems in Boma to a lack of women's education and empowerment. Harmful traditional practices, such as early marriage, persist, resulting in underage pregnancies. Women are often required to obtain permission from their husbands before seeking healthcare. ""The problem is that illiteracy levels are so high, so many of our patients don't really understand about disease, and then if they do decide to seek treatment, the road network is so poor, with a lot of insecurity around, so it is very difficult for them to [access] healthcare,"" she said. ""Most patients only come to the hospital very late, after complications have set in, so we are generally dealing with more complicated cases that would have been easier to treat in their early stages."" Besides widespread malnutrition and pregnancy-related complications, other common illnesses in Boma include malaria, acute respiratory tract infections, acute watery diarrhoea, sexually transmitted infections, skin diseases and intestinal parasites, Kasoga said. But the job is rewarding. The work ""gives me the feeling that I am providing services to those who need them the most. I am the only doctor in a 150km radius, and I get immense satisfaction by delivering quality healthcare to the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in such an underserved area,"" she said.

"The article discusses the shortage of medical staff, facilities, and training in South Sudan, which has the highest rate of maternal and infant mortality in the world. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have been running the hospital in Lankien since 1995 to treat kala-azar, a disease transmitted by sand flies. The majority of medical care in South Sudan is provided by foreign organizations like MSF, as there are only 120 doctors and 80 qualified nurses for a population of around eight million southern Sudanese. Training and education is also a major problem, with 85% of the population being illiterate, and it is expected to take around twenty years before a sufficient number of southern Sudanese will have received proper medical training. Girls are particularly disadvantaged in terms of education due to cultural beliefs. There is also a shortage of training institutes for blue-collar workers like mechanics, builders, and electricians.","Every morning the corridors of Lankien's only hospital are filled with the sound of children crying and adults groaning in pain. It's that time of the day when patients - small or tall - are given life saving injections against kala-azar. The injection hurts because the medicine is syrupy and has to be administered slowly. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have been running the hospital in Lankien, to the northeast of South Sudan, since 1995. Preparations are underway for the peak of an epidemic of kala-azar that started last year. The parasites that cause the disease are transmitted by sand flies which become very active in the rainy season which just started in South Sudan. The symptoms of kala-azar are skin sores that erupt weeks to months after the person affected is bitten by sand flies. Other consequences, which can manifest anywhere from a few months to years after infection, include fever, damage to the spleen and liver, and anemia. 120 doctors for 8 million people ""The patients are people who sleep in the open, like soldiers, traders, nomads and very poor people,"" explains Dutch doctor Hanna Jellema. The patients need between one or two dozen injections to save their lives. The majority of the medical care in South Sudan, which gains independence on the 9th of July, is given by foreign organizations like MSF. There are 120 doctors and some 80 qualified nurses for a population of around eight million southern Sudanese. Patients have to walk for days at times to reach a health facility. South Sudan has the highest rate of maternal and infant mortality in the world. The 54th African nation-to-be is extremely underdeveloped after decades of war and an almost complete lack of progress. Building hospitals and clinics isn't high on the government's to do list in the capital of Juba. The authorities rely for the time being on foreign medical aid. ""I'm afraid it will take a while before MSF can hand over this hospital to the government because of the shortage of trained medical staff,"" says Hanna Jellema. Illiteracy Training and education is another major problem for the new country. The Ministry of Health expects that it will take around twenty years before a sufficient number of southern Sudanese will have received proper medical training. Some 85 percent of the population is illiterate. Over one million people have attended primary school, but the attendance rate is still one of the lowest in the world. This caused by a lack of classrooms, teachers, school materials and the need for children to work to add to the meager income of their parents. ""Another big obstacle is the culture that prevents girls to go to school,"" says teacher Nyang Tal of the biggest primary school in Leer, a town 200 kilometer west of Lankien. ""Especially nomadic parents as they do not see the need to educate their daughters. They keep them at home until they are old enough to collect the dowry of dozens of cows."" Nyang Tal is not trained as a teacher. He only went to primary school for eight years, in a refugee camp in neighbouring Uganda. In his spare time he follows courses in education. Blue collar jobs Besides a lack of primary and secondary schools, South Sudan also battles with a shortage of training institutes for blue collar workers like mechanics, builders and electricians. Foreigners from countries in the region take up most of these jobs. Nyang Tal speaks reasonable English, which has been adopted as the official language of South Sudan. Though not fluent, he is still better at speaking English than most people who stayed behind during the war and only speak their tribal language and Arabic. ""I worry about my mistakes in English because I will teach it to the pupils,"" says the young teacher. ""I'm afraid that the present generation of school children will not be perfectly educated.
