"The article discusses how Nile FM, a humanitarian information service in Malakal in Upper Nile State, South Sudan, is empowering local people and delivering information to help keep the peace in the protection of civilians (Poc) site, where more than 25,000 people from the area's major tribes are seeking refuge from the fighting. The service aims to deliver 'news you can use' and reduce tensions by providing timely, effective, fair and accurate information to people. The service also collaborates with humanitarian agencies and listens to local people to tailor their responses accordingly. The article also mentions the expansion of the service to Bor in Jonglei state.","Nile FM, a humanitarian information service in Malakal in Upper Nile State, is empowering local people and delivering information to help keep the peace Julia Ding races down the dirt path: beads of sweat pour down her forehead and her face is contorted with fear. She collapses on to her knees outside Nile FM radio station. A tear rolls down her face. The bullets continue to rain down as staff scramble to lock up the radio station - a large khaki-green tent with a small mast protruding from the top. Humanitarian workers run towards bunkers, while others jump into dried-out ditches for protection. This was the scene at the protection of civilians (Poc) site in Malakal in South Sudan’s Upper Nile State when fighting broke out on 21 April. The site, which is on the UN base just outside the town, is now a hissing pressure cooker. The Poc is a microcosm of South Sudan’s wider civil conflict. More than 25,000 people from the area’s major tribes are seeking refuge from the fighting; Dinka, Shilluk, and Nuer are all here for safety, shelter and basic services. Ensuring that the wider conflict is not played out inside the PoC has been a priority for agencies trying to deliver services. A quarrel at the water point or in a food distribution queue can quickly escalate. Getting timely, effective, fair and accurate information to people is critical in keeping a lid on tensions. That is where Nile FM, a project run by Internews’ humanitarian information service, comes in. The service started in Malakal last year as a low-tech “mini-media” offering, providing a 20-minute audio programme “made by the community for the community”. It mirrored a project in the capital, Juba, where programmes are recorded on USB sticks and played on speakers at strategic locations, such as health clinics and water collection points. The speakers are carried on quad bikes, earning the service the name Boda Boda Talk Talk (BBTT), a reference to the local word for “motorbike”. In February, the Malakal service became a fully fledged radio station, sitting alongside other critical humanitarian actors in the Poc. Nile FM uses the same principles as the mini-media service. While traditional news media tells its audience what has happened, Nile FM asks people what they need to know in times of crisis, aiming to deliver “news you can use”. During the fighting in April, Nile FM immediately switched to emergency programming. All live phone calls were stopped and the music selection was cleaned up to avoid potentially divisive songs being aired. Public service announcements were increased, including a two-minute drama urging children not to climb trees when shooting starts, an explanation of what unexploded objects look like, and a compilation of community voices called People for Peace.Advertisement Most of the radio’s work focused on reducing tensions. On the second day of fighting, Nile FM staff gathered for a morning news meeting. Ding, who works as a journalist, was back with the team of 10 correspondents, all of whom fled to the Poc during fighting in Malakal last year. When they arrived, some of them had never even opened a laptop and had certainly never conducted interviews. Now the team buzzes with story ideas, drawn from people living in the Poc site. “Everyone is talking about how the youths are going into town to ‘salvage’ goods from the destroyed market. If they go, they should be worried about being forced to join the army,” said correspondent Anthony Thon De Diew, a former child soldier. “Students want to know what will happen to the examination they were due to sit today with the exam paper now inaccessible in town,” says former teacher Lorince Nyawela, another correspondent. With new people arriving daily, everyone is concerned about increased pressure on water services. And they want to know why traders have increased the price of sugar and basic commodities by 90% in just two days. The humanitarian information service shows that the right information can dispel rumour, reduce tensions and calm communities, who often feel disempowered during conflict and subsequent aid responses. As well as working with communities, the service collaborates with humanitarian agencies, who tend to focus on top-down, one-way communications; the ubiquitous hand-washing posters with the child squatting and using a latrine, telling people what to do without enough evidence of impact. Through the service, aid agencies can listen to local people and tailor their responses accordingly. BBTT is just starting up in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, where it will aim to serve a small population of displaced people from the Nuer community. In Malakal, now that the latest spasm of fighting has calmed, the team continues to deliver vital information to help keep the peace.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,-1,0
"The article discusses South Sudan's foreign minister calling on the international community to support countries afflicted by food shortages due to factors beyond their control. The Horn of Africa Hunger Crisis conference in Nairobi focused on both short and long term measures to avert starvation in the Horn of Africa. South Sudan offered to help financially and provide troops to the African Union mission supporting the Somalia government, despite suffering from food shortages itself. The article also mentions the deaths and displacement caused by conflict in South Sudan.","Juba — South Sudan's foreign minister on Sunday called on the international community to fulfill its historical obligation to supporting countries that are afflicted by serious shortages of food due to factors that are beyond their control. It is estimated that 750,000 people could die in Somalia in a famine caused by conflict and natural causes. Nhial Deng Nhial, made the appeal in Nairobi on the closing day of the Horn of Africa Hunger Crisis conference that focused on both short and long term measures to avert starvation in the Horn of Africa. The minister whose statement was broadcasted live on South Sudan Television and Radio informed the delegates at the summit that policy aimed at providing subsidised fertilizers and high yield seeds to small-scale farmers would be one of the substitutes to global food crisis. Nhial a senior member of the high level delegation led by South Sudan's President Salva Kiir Mayardit, which left Juba on Thursday for Nairobi, Kenya, to attend the two-day meeting that brought together different heads of state and government to the summit chaired by the Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. The summit which saw participation of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed of Somalia, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and representatives of government leaderships in Africa and beyond. Sharing experience on strategies employed to fight hunger in the newly established State of South Sudan, minister Nhial said provision of subsidy to farmers would help the country increase production food. ""The shortage of food that afflicts the continent results from poor production based on subsistence farming. Agriculture in Africa lacks mechanisation to a large extent, hence the need to support small-scale farmers,"" he said. He proposed effective use of existing water sources like rivers, lakes and dams for irrigation in all areas that are privileged with such water resources to supplement production that cannot be achieved in dry areas. ""We have made attempts to introduce modern agriculture schemes including irrigation in different places in the big six regions with reliable rainfall. These regions have been detailed to feed the whole country, and we have logged success."" South Sudan has offered to help financially to address the famine and to provide troops to the African Union mission supporting the Somalia government. The offers of assistance come despite South Sudan itself suffering from food shortages and relying on aid agencies to feed a lot of its population, especially those displaced by conflict or those that have returned from North Sudan. A recent UN report found that conflict has led to the deaths of more than 1,500 people and the displacement of over 73,000 in recent months. In July South Sudan became independent and the offer of aid is seen as gesture of its arrival on the international stage.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,0,1

The flood caused structural damage to houses, roads, schools and health facilities. Aid organizations are mobilizing to provide urgent needs including water and sanitation, household items, emergency shelter, health, nutrition, education and protection in the affected communities. The road network has deteriorated in most parts making it challenging to deliver assistance.","Juba, South Sudan — An inter-agency assessment conducted in Tonj South County in Warrap State identiﬁed about 3,300 people displaced after Wanalel River burst its banks. The assessment team identiﬁed water and sanitation, household items, emergency shelter, health, nutrition, education and protection as the most urgent needs for the ﬂood-affected communities. Efforts by aid orga nizations to deliver assistance were challenged by lack of access as the road network has deteriorated in most parts of Gogrial West and Tonj East and South countries. In Tonj South, the road between Tonj town and Thiet Payam has been cut off by ﬂooding from Wanalel River. This means that people cannot access the market. In Gogrial West County the road from Kuajok to Wunrok is impassible but authorities were working on improving road access. Aid organizations working with local authorities are now mobilizing to respond to the identiﬁed needs of the affected people as soon as access improves. According to the authorities, the ﬂoods also caused structural damage to houses, roads, schools and health facilities.

"The article discusses the United Nations' former aid chief Jan Egeland's statement that aid agencies are failing to protect and reach vulnerable people in locations such as Syria, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Egeland called for more investment in staff and fostering acceptance from warring sides. He also highlighted a lack of progress in gaining access to all people in need of help and protecting them from abuses. Egeland cited initiatives such as teaching students in religious schools in Afghanistan about humanitarian work as a way to build acceptance of aid work in local communities. Additionally, Egeland called for a political and diplomatic solution to emergencies in hotspots such as Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Gaza.","London — From Syria to South Sudan, humanitarians are failing to protect and reach some of the most vulnerable people caught up in war or hit by natural disasters, the United Nations' former aid chief Jan Egeland said on Wednesday. Too many aid agencies are not good enough at fostering acceptance from warring sides in a conflict or investing in staff willing to work in particularly tough places such as Central African Republic, Egeland said. ""We, still, are not there at all for some of the most vulnerable communities on Earth. In Syria, we're still not reaching hundreds of communities,"" said Egeland, now the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). ""It's the worst war on our watch. We're doing good work for refugees in neighbouring countries but too few organisations are able and willing to go deep into Syria - the same in the Central African Republic, in South Sudan,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. ""I would have hoped we would be in places where there's the greatest need and not just where it's easier to respond."" Syria's civil war has left some 10.8 million people - half the country's population - in need of assistance. More than 6 million have been uprooted inside Syria and another 3 million have fled the country. ""UNMITIGATED OUTRAGE"" Egeland was speaking from Washington D.C. where he is due to address an event marking 50 years since the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance - responsible for leading the U.S. government's response to disasters overseas - was set up. Egeland, who was the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator between 2003 and 2006, said aid workers in the past 50 years had become better at saving lives, providing healthcare, education, water and sanitation to stricken populations. He estimated that 50 years ago, about 5 percent of those affected by conflict or natural disasters received emergency relief, compared with around 80 percent today. However, there had been ""remarkably little"" progress gaining access to all people in need of help, protecting them from abuses and preventing humanitarian crises including those exacerbated by climate change, Egeland said. For example, in South Sudan, reports assessing the humanitarian response to civilians fleeing clashes between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his sacked deputy, Riek Machar, found that some camps for the displaced did not have separate toilets for men and women. ""They were not lit at night, there were no locks on the doors. Women were routinely abused when they went to the toilet,"" Egeland said. He cited an initiative by NRC to teach students in religious schools in Afghanistan about humanitarian work as one way of building acceptance of aid work in local communities that could be replicated elsewhere. Egeland, who as the U.N. aid chief dealt with conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, an insurgency in northern Uganda and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, called for a push to find political and diplomatic solutions to emergencies in hotspots such as Central African Republic, South Sudan and Gaza. ""It's an unmitigated outrage that we return with our blankets and with our relief to the same places every 5 years or 50 years,"" he said.

"The article discusses the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, which has claimed around 10,000 lives since December 2013. Rebel forces have attacked numerous towns, causing almost 400,000 people to flee their homes. Mingkaman, a river town on the White Nile, has seen its population grow eightfold as people seek relative safety and humanitarian aid. However, the influx has strained resources and created a potential tipping point. There are also concerns about food security and disease outbreaks. The situation is similarly dire in the capital city of Juba, where tens of thousands of people could be at risk during the rainy season.","Mingkaman — Chor, 22, arrived hungry and dehydrated at Mingkaman, a small South Sudanese river town on the White Nile, after an eight-hour boat ride made all the more uncomfortable by the presence of a bullet lodged in his lower back. On 31 December, rebel forces had streaked through his home town of Bor - about 20km to the north - shooting indiscriminately at civilians. Chor had hidden beside his older brother under a bed in their family's house. The pair had returned there to collect belongings while the rest of the family waited by the river outside town. Bullets shot by renegade soldiers hit his brother in the chest and Chor in the lower back. His brother died, but Chor survived to make the journey to Mingkaman, where he is seeking medical attention. The capture of Bor came two weeks after a political power struggle between President Salva Kir and the deputy he sacked in July 2013, Riek Machar, turned violent in Juba. The unrest quickly spread to many parts of the world's newest state. According to the International Crisis Group, the conflict has claimed around 10,000 lives. Many victims have been civilians targeted according to their ethnic group (Kiir is a Dinka, Machar a Nuer). Almost 400,000 people have fled their homes, one in 10 of them to neighbouring countries such as Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Recent violence has seen Mingkaman's population swell eightfold to around 80,000, as people flock there for its relative safety and the growing presence of humanitarian agencies. Many of the new arrivals lack adequate shelter or regular sources of clean water and food. ""Acute human suffering"" Trees are scant and highly prized, both for the shelter they provide from the scorching heat and for the branches that can be used for hanging mosquito nets. People crowd beneath every tree as far as the eye can see. Members of the host population say they are overwhelmed. Most permanent structures are either surrounded by crowds of the displaced or have been requisitioned for use by local emergency response teams. The situation is reaching a ""tipping point"", according to the NGO Plan. The population of the county has nearly tripled, from 47,000 to over 130,000, according to district authorities. And the influx is not over yet. By 11 January, more than a thousand people were still arriving every day by boat from Bor and areas north of Bor, paying up to 150 South Sudanese pounds (US$30) per person for passage. Long wooden boats pull up in the small harbour each morning, bearing exhausted families and their belongings. Some bring nothing, having fled the violence in such a hurry, while others wade through the Nile's water bearing aloft mattresses and shade cloth. Residents of the camp stand anxiously on the bank, scanning the incoming crowd for lost friends and relatives. A number of those arriving in Mingkaman say they recently fled Pariak, a town south of Bor. Their testimonies described looting and gunfire by men dressed mostly in military uniform. ""They started on Sunday [5 January],"" says Daniel Baidit, who has travelled for two days to get here. ""They killed a lot of people, chased people away, burned their houses, and took food and other items."" ""There is acute human suffering in the country, with children and women bearing the brunt of the fighting,"" said Hazel Nyathi, acting regional director for Plan. In Mingkaman, armed men in civilian clothing mingled among the IDPs. ""They're killing women and children. I need this to protect myself and my family,"" one man said, holding an AK47 rifle at his side. Most of the armed men are members of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) - the country's now divided national army - who must return to fight for Bor. Unconfirmed reports of forced recruitment in the camp circulate, but the combatants IRIN spoke with all said that they chose to join up. Agencies are not reporting any major security breaches, and a UN source says the presence of the SPLA has not become a major concern. Although young men are returning to their homes across the river in Jonglei State to tend to their cattle, guard their houses or fetch belongings, few feel that it is safe to do so. The sound of rockets and jet engines from Bor, which loyalist forces are poised to try to retake, reminds Mingkaman residents of their vulnerability. ""The fighting has started to target anyone,"" a humanitarian responder in Mingkaman said. Humanitarian response Medics have treated elderly women and children as young as four suffering gunshot wounds. When people flooded into Mingkaman at the end of December, ""90 percent went to the river and drank the Nile water"", a Médecins Sans Frontières worker says. ""Food is still a big concern, and it gets very cold at night"". The poor sanitation has given rise to fears of a cholera outbreak. Nile water is now being chlorinated, and there are out-patient and in-patient clinics in operation. The International Committee of the Red Cross has sent a large convoy of trucks with supplies from Juba, around 140km south on a bad road. The UN Humanitarian Air Service has resumed helicopter flights, and some of the NGOs that left are starting to return. ""Resources are stretched thin in a place where resources were thin to begin with,"" said one aid worker. Longer-term fears The situation is little better in the capital, Juba, where 17,000 people are living inside the United Nations peacekeeping force's military base, on an area suitable for less than a quarter that number. ""When you're battling heat and insufficient amounts of water and toilets, it's a recipe for disease and tension. They're literally sleeping side by side each night,"" the Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, Toby Lanzer, explained. Already, the UN is preparing to relocate these people to a more appropriate space, should they still be there when the rains come in April. ""If we get to April, we've got a very serious situation. There is water and mud everywhere. If we were to have tens of thousands there in the rainy season, it would be untenable,"" he said. A month of violence has also threatened food security across much of the country, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ""It is essential that security and stability return to South Sudan immediately so that displaced people can return to their homes, fields, herds and fishing grounds. Timing is everything; there are fish in the rivers now, pastoralists are trying to protect their herds, and the planting season for maize, groundnut and sorghum starts in March,"" Sue Lautze, FAO representative in South Sudan, said in a statement. ""Even before the recent fighting... some 4.4 million people were already estimated to be facing food insecurity in South Sudan in 2014. Of those, 830,000 were facing acute food insecurity,"" said Dominique Burgeon, director of FAO's emergency and rehabilitation division.

"The article discusses how the brutal conflict in South Sudan has cut off the food supply to Sudanese refugees in Maban County, Upper Nile State, causing hunger and tensions that have led to a deadly crime wave and prompted thousands to return to the war-zone they fled from. Aid agencies struggle to provide basic services to displaced people across a country with few all-weather roads or airstrips, and in the midst of a brutal and unpredictable conflict. The lack of food has led to refugees developing survival strategies, such as selling their tools and livestock. Aid agencies and local residents have been targeted with armed gangs stealing large quantities of food from warehouses. Officials said about 2,000 people left the camp in April and returned to Blue Nile and that more could follow if the food shortage continues. The growing insecurity caused by the South Sudan crisis might force them to flee the camps. Maban has been spared in the fighting, which has pitted ethnic Dinkas aligned with President Kiir against Machar's fellow Nuers.","South Sudan's brutal conflict has throttled the supply of food to Sudanese refugees in the remote northeast of the country, fuelling tensions and hunger that have triggered a deadly crime wave and prompted thousands to return to the war-zone from which they fled. Some 126,000 Sudanese refugees housed in four camps in Maban County, Upper Nile State, are caught between an intensifying war in their homeland and the fighting that broke out in December between forces loyal to South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and those of his former deputy, Riek Machar. While the conflict has yet to reach the camps, it has cut off access to Maban, triggering a food crisis that must compete for the attention of aid agencies already swamped by the urgent needs of 1.5 million others uprooted by the recent violence. ""We are sitting on dynamite here,"" Adan Ilmi, the top UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) official in Maban, told IRIN. ""Any slight thing can create serious conflict between the refugees and the host community, among the refugees themselves, or against the humanitarian agencies."" Refugees poured into Maban in 2011 after the Sudanese government launched a military offensive against rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Army - North (SPLA-N) in Sudan's South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions. Sudanese warplanes have reportedly stepped up their bombing campaign this year, drawing condemnation from the USA. While safe from the bombardment in neighbouring Blue Nile, camp-dwellers have faced months of meagre food rations as UN agencies have struggled to feed and provide basic services to displaced people across a country with few all-weather roads or airstrips, and in the midst of a brutal and unpredictable conflict. Fighting in the northeast has prevented the UN World Food Program (WFP) from trucking in supplies stockpiled in neighbouring Ethiopia; insecurity also halted barge traffic on the Nile River - a key transport artery in the rainy season now under way; airdrops from Ethiopia were hamstrung by a fuel shortage; and a hastily chartered C-130 aircraft can deliver only 40 percent of the 2,200 tons needed in Maban every month. According to WFP, the camps received enough rations for only seven days in March, 10 days in April, and 20 days in May. A 15-day ration was distributed in early June, with WFP hoping to deliver more before the end of the month. Future supplies depend heavily on restarting barge traffic and opening roads from the towns of Melut and Renk, where stocks of sorghum are available. WFP was also negotiating with Sudanese officials to bring supplies across the northern border by air and boat. Refugee camp lacks food This IRIN reporter visited Doro, one of the four camps, when aid workers were distributing the latest rations. Istor Ali, a 40-year-old woman in the long, slow-moving queue, said her four children had eaten little for five days. The youngest, aged two, had been crying a lot. His face had swollen up and he had fainted repeatedly, she said. The youngster showed classic symptoms of malnutrition. So why had she not taken him to the camp's hospital? ""I don't think he is sick,"" Ali said defiantly, ""just hungry."" When the reporter recounted her case at the hospital, a doctor smiled ruefully. ""People have become used to things that they shouldn't have to,"" said Joel Selvakumar, a Norwegian working for medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). In March and April, the number of patients visiting MSF's therapeutic feeding centre spiked to as much as double that seen a year earlier. However, malnutrition rates have remained below emergency levels - perhaps because of the lengths refugees have gone to in order to find additional food. Rather than attending school, bands of children have ventured out to pick fruits and edible leaves or to hunt birds. Women cut firewood to sell in the nearby town of Bunj. They also go to the town to work at market stalls, do laundry and to sell bread and water. Many of these survival strategies bring problems. Women say local residents chase refugees from the land, sometimes violently, seizing their tools and livestock. Aid workers worry that some women have been drawn into transactional sex. ""A person in need can do anything,"" Syla Musa, the chairman of the Doro camp residents committee, told IRIN. ""If the girls are out in the market, they also can do anything."" Clashes Local residents are also among the victims. According to James Pasha, the top government official in Maban, at least 14 people have died in clashes between refugees and local residents in the past three months. In one recent incident, Ilmi said, a local resident was killed and 20 cattle stolen. Youths from the camps are blamed for a string of raids on sorghum stores in villages near the camps, he added. Aid agencies have also been targeted. Armed gangs have stolen large quantities of food from warehouses at the camp. Ilmi said the local police were outgunned, and the refugees did not want to risk their lives defending the supplies. Pasha suggested the thieves were SPLM-N fighters ""from the front line in Blue Nile"" and were stealing in order to feed their families in the camps. Signs of desperation In another sign of desperation, refugee families have sold off vital household possessions, including tarpaulins from the roofs of their houses. Humanitarian agencies distribute so-called non-food items, also including cooking utensils and mosquito nets, every year before the seasonal rains. But the lack of food means these items have been held back out of concern that they too will be sold, leaving some without protection as the rains intensify and malaria infections soar. The distribution of 45 tons of seed that could help ease the food shortage has also been pushed back until after the June food distribution, even though it would soon be too late to plant. Aid workers fear hungry refugees will eat the seed rather than sow it in the small plots around their makeshift homes. Ed Hughes of the Danish Refugee Council, an NGO which manages the Doro camp, said refugees were increasingly unlikely to sow the seed. The delay meant prospective yields would be lower, and some refugees were worried that they might be displaced again, he told IRIN. Officials said about 2,000 people left the camp in April and returned to Blue Nile and that more could follow if the food shortage continues. In many other families, men had returned alone and temporarily in order to cultivate land in their villages, despite the dangers. Josepa Musa, a 27-year-old woman comforting her malnourished twin sons on a bed at the camp hospital, said her husband had returned to Blue Nile in May to plant maize, sorghum, pumpkins and water melon. He would return to Maban after the harvest in October. Musa said her husband and other farmers would dig holes in the ground and hide in them if they heard the approach of the Sudanese air force's feared Antonov bombers, which have reportedly dropped 300 bombs in Blue Nile in the first half of 2014. In his absence, she said she had worked in a tea shop in Bunj, grown sorghum on a small plot in the forest, and gathered firewood to earn a little money. ""I am not getting enough to eat myself, so I don't have enough breast milk for the children,"" she told IRIN. Refugees are concerned that the growing insecurity caused by the South Sudan crisis might even force them to flee the camps. So far, Maban has been spared in the fighting, which has pitted ethnic Dinkas aligned with President Kiir against Machar's fellow Nuers. Tensions rising However, tensions have been rising. In May, Nuer civil servants abandoned Maban and many fearful civilians followed them south to opposition strongholds. UNHRC's Ilmi said many Nuers and Dinkas working for aid agencies in Maban had subsequently quit, weakening a relief effort already struggling because of a lack of experienced staff. At the same time, the South Sudanese army redeployed its troops in the area, leaving only Nuer soldiers in Maban and shifting Dinkas to another barracks - a move opposed by Pasha, the county commissioner. ""This is the national army, not a tribal army,"" he said. ""If we separate them, maybe they will start fighting."" Camp chairman Musa forecast that, if slow-moving peace talks between Kiir and Machar failed to bring peace, and the fighting engulfed Maban, most of the Sudanese refugees would try to cross back into Blue Nile. ""If that happens, we will lose so many people,"" he said quietly. ""There are many people who won't make it that far.""

"The article discusses the plight of refugees from South Sudan who have fled to Ethiopia due to the ongoing conflict between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar. The refugees are faced with overcrowded camps, lack of shelter, and inadequate living conditions. Many are women and children who have walked for days to escape the violence in their home country. The UNHCR is calling for a long-term solution to the crisis with peace being an absolute must for the refugees to return home.","The conflict in South Sudan has displaced thousands of people. Many have crossed the border into Ethiopia only to find themselves in overcrowded refugee camps. The rainy season adds to their woes. Every day some 1,200 refugees from South Sudan arrive in Ethiopia, most of them women and children. They sleep in tents, often on wet ground. The refugees are fleeing from the conflict in South Sudan that erupted in December 2013. The conflict is between the government of President Salva Kiir and his former vice president, now rebel leader, Riek Machar. A cry of pain is heard from one of the tents in the Kule refugee camp. A South Sudanese family has just witnessed the death of their six month-old baby. They had walked for 25 days to escape the conflict in their home country. Now their child is dead. The refugees are living in appalling conditions in the camps. Overcrowded tents are filled mostly with women, children and old men. Most wear tattered clothes and have no shoes. All they have is what they managed to carry on their long walk to to escape the violence in the world's youngest nation. Tents provide little shelter On arrival, refugees are usually allocated individual tents that have a roof but are otherwise exposed to the open air. More people arrive every day in the overcrowded camps To keep away the cold, especially at night, they fasten blankets and pieces of cloth to the main tent. They sleep on the ground. Since the onset of the rainy season, the ground is constantly wet and muddy. Bol Gadcoth says this is the second time he's become a refugee. The first time, he spent close to 10 years in a camp during the civil war between North and South Sudan. He hopes this time will be shorter. ""I don't want to be in refugee camps for two years or even one year. I don't like it , I want to go back within a few months,"" he said. Peter Jiech Ruach was a local politician in Malakal, one of the regional states of South Sudan. Together with five family members, he also fled. They walked for nine days to the refugee camp. Ruach used to live abroad and had only just returned to his native land. ""I came from America where I was for 19 years. It's better to live in your own country, that's why I came back,"" he said. Peace in South Sudan 'is a must' Ethiopia is now hosting over 80,000 refugees from South Sudan. The numbers are steadily increasing. Kule camp was built to accommodate 25,000 refugees, it now has 40,000. Refugees share a meal in Kule camp Antonio Guterres, the High Commissioner of the UN refugee agency UNHCR recently visited the camps in Ethiopia. He said the situation in South Sudan was dire and that a long term solution was needed. ""Even if we provide the best possible assistance, this is not the solution. We don't want to see the South Sudanese again remaining in exile in these countries for many years. Peace is an absolute must,"" Guterres said. But until peace returns to South Sudan, these camps, despite their harsh conditions, will remain home for the many thousands of refugees.",NEGATIVE,,refugees,-1,-1

The appeal from Bor Community Association in the Diaspora to the governors of Equatoria for the welfare of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Bor was interesting. One would have expected that the appeal should have been instead directed to the Bor IDPs, earnestly urging them to embrace peaceful co-existence with the communities in Equatoria. The Bor IDPs have been violent on the local communities. Who are IDPs? This is not meant to be a sarcastic or a cynical question but rather for an understanding. IDPs can be defined as people who are forced out of their homes or ancestral lands within a region or a country either by natural disasters or man-made problems. Natural disasters include floods that destroy homes and man-made problems include conflicts that may become bitterly fought wars, displacing thousands of people within the state, region or the country. In the case of South Sudan currently IDPs are a reflection of the on-going conflict in the country. The division of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) into SPLM in Government and the SPLM in Opposition and the subsequent conflict, has created massive displacement of people from their homes and ancestral lands. This in turn has produced enormous populations of IDPs where some are housed by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) camps. Other IDPs find their way to the adjacent states for security or to the neighboring countries to become refugees. Bor IDPs in Equatoria For the people of Bor the safest place to enjoy security is Equatoria. This is not only during the current conflict between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) into SPLM in Government and the SPLM in Opposition but even during the 21-year old war of liberation. Equatoria has always been a safe haven for people of Bor. It is not clear whether the Bor IDPs in Equatoria have been complaining of any mistreatment by the host communities. It is important to note that the people of Equatoria and those of Bor are of two distinct cultures. The people of Equatoria are predominantly sedentary farmers in contrast to those of Bor who are pastoralists. As farmers the people of Equatoria are mindful of boundaries and won't encroach into a neighbor's field. In contrast the main livelihood of people of Bor is cattle keeping and the movements of cattle are conditioned by the availability of pastures. As always cattle do not distinguish between pastures and food crops. This is where problems occur between sedentary farmers (Equatorians) and pastoralists (people of Bor). Quite often pastoralists deliberately let loose their cattle to feed on food crops in the fields. When the farmers protest the pastoralists have no sympathy but instead threaten violence in protecting their cattle in feeding on food crops. In Equatoria Bor IDPs have been the problem. They are always armed, arrogant and insensitive of the feelings and situation of the host communities. Instead of behaving like guests, the Bor IDPs behave like the masters of the land or landlords. What would one expect? Of course resentment from the host communities who are powerless because the IDPs seem to have the support of some powerful quarters. IDPs in host communities Generally IDPs are like uninvited guests of the host communities. However, because of the conditions that have made people IDPs in the first place, the host communities are sometimes sympathetic. Land is availed to the IDPs and the host communities may be willing to share resources with the IDPs. People of Equatoria are well known for being peaceful. This may explain why Equatoria is the safe haven for most warring pastoralists in South Sudan especially IDPs from Bor. The peaceful nature of the people of Equatoria has attracted people from any corner of South Sudan to make a home in Equatoria. Somebody may say Equatoria is a part of South Sudan and so any South Sudanese has the right to settle in Equatoria. This is true. However, how can people abandon their ancestral areas undeveloped just to settle in Equatoria? Who will develop those areas for a high standard of living for the people there? Those who have travelled length and breadth of South Sudan confirm that Equatoria is moving fast in development while other areas hardly see any meaningful development. Those areas are lagging behind. People of Bor seem to take their status of IDP as an advantage to occupy the lands of Equatoria and then use the barrel of the gun to oppress the people. The current conflict in the country is not the only one that has pushed the people of Bor to Equatoria as IDPs. During the 21-year war of liberation, Equatoria was the safe haven for all, flooded with IDPs from the other regions. After the 21-year old war ended did the IDPs from Bor move back to Bor? Never! Instead they consolidated their hold on lands in Equatoria. The Bor IDPs in Nimule are an example of brutal occupation of Equatoria lands with constant threats of violence on the host communities. So the appeal from the Bor Community Association in the Diaspora to the governors of Equatoria is adding insult to injury. The Bor IDPs in Equatoria are well armed, arrogant and intimidating the local communities on daily basis. The Bor IDPs in Equatoria are the problem but not the peaceful people of Equatoria. This should be noted by anybody who has common sense. Appeal to Bor IDPs The Bor Community Association in the Diaspora is well advised to instead appeal to their community leaders in Equatoria to urge their violent IDPs to embrace peaceful co-existence as the people of Equatoria are already peaceful. The people of Equatoria have neither threatened violence on Bor IDPs nor harm their cattle. It is instead the Bor IDPs that are wanton in behavior and deliberately letting loose their cattle in a sadistic manner to destroy food crops, thereby causing unnecessary food insecurity to the people of Equatoria. The Bor Community Association is informed that the Bor IDPs will always threaten violence whenever their cattle are stopped from feeding on food crops in Equatoria. Now to where should the appeal for a peaceful co-existence be directed. The Bor Community Association in the Diaspora should stop being tribalistic if it is truly nationalistic. Tribalism is already tearing the country apart. How far should we allow this to happen? Conclusion The Bor Community Association in the Diaspora appeal to the governors of Equatoria would have been in place if the people of Equatoria were behaving like pastoralists who were always inclined to threats of violence on the peaceful people of Equatoria. The Bor IDPs in Equatoria were welcomed and respected but have now abused that respect. As the story of the Arab and the camel goes the Bor IDPs cast their eyes on Equatoria lands with unrestrained appetite to occupy them permanently with no due consideration for the local communities and their legitimate right of ownership of the land. The IDPs virtually refused to return to Bor because probably some powerful elements were on their side until the current conflict is adding more IDPs to the existing ones. Equatoria is a peaceful region and any IDP is expected to reciprocate to integrate. However, pastoralists IDPs in Equatoria have introduced a culture of brute violence where land grabbing is done by force. IDPs deliberately let loose their cattle to graze on food crops by force. Everything is a macho culture. In conclusion, the members of Bor Community in the Diaspora who have experienced peaceful co-existence in their respective adopted countries should pioneer the concept of peaceful co-existence among their pastoralist communities. The sedentary people of Equatoria are ever peaceful and they do not need a lecture on peaceful co-existence from culturally violent people who have no sense of peaceful co-existence. The problem is of pastoralists own making and they need to solve it. People of Equatoria are peaceful and respectful, and they do not expect less.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,refugees,0,0

Many of the new arrivals are in desperate condition, and large numbers of children need urgent intervention to address malnourishment. Water shortages present a life-threatening risk, particularly for an already weakened population. UNHCR's funding needs for Sudanese refugees in South Sudan and Ethiopia stand at US$ 219.9 million with less than 21% of needs received so far.","This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards - to whom quoted text may be attributed - at the press briefing, on 22 June 2012, at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. UNHCR on Thursday appealed to donors to urgently provide additional funding for its operations to help Sudanese refugees in South Sudan and neighbouring Ethiopia. Currently there are some 162,500 refugees in South Sudan and 36,500 in Ethiopia. The contributions we have received for South Sudan have been exhausted. The situation for refugees in South Sudan is among the most critical UNHCR now faces anywhere. At the time of our initial appeal in January we had planned on the basis of a refugee population in South Sudan not exceeding 135,000 people. However, the sharp surge in arrivals in recent weeks in Upper Nile state in particular has seen this figure being exceeded by nearly 30,000 people, and with arrivals continuing at an average rate of 1000 a day. Many of the new arrivals are in desperate condition, and large numbers of children need urgent intervention to address malnourishment. We are very concerned about the growing mortality rates in the refugee camps and are establishing a baseline survey to gain a better picture of the situation. Water shortages present a life-threatening risk, particularly for an already weakened population. Currently UNHCR is not expecting a further dramatic increase in arrivals in Ethiopia and consequently our funding needs there remain unchanged. For South Sudan, however, our new appeal allows for a refugee population of up to 235,000 by year's end. With this revised appeal, our needs for Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia and South Sudan stand at US$ 219.9 million. Currently we have received US$45.9 million (US$11.6 million for Ethiopia and US$33.6 million for South Sudan), representing less than 21 per cent of needs.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,humanitarian,0,0

The Deputy Minister of Health Dr. Yatta Loli Lugar visited the hospital to witness arrangement of emergency facilities organized by the hospital for receiving the victims who were wounded during the attack. Juba Hospital is in its full capacity that requires emergency wards for receiving large number of people wounded during the Lou Nuer attack on Murle in Jonglei State. Dr. Lugar said that he was shocked when he saw a woman who was wounded and her baby shot on the leg and next to her was a baby whose mother and father were believed to have been killed. The Minister condemned the attackers saying that people should forget inter-tribal conflict, describing it as primitive that would not help to develop this country. He emphasized that people should embark on development in all sectors instead of engaging in baseless conflicts which cause loss of lives. Lugar said plans to upgrade the facilities of Juba Hospital are on the way because its capacity is now very low to hold big size of population in the city.

Last year the South Sudan government arrested four foreigners from Uganda, Kenya, Congo and Belgium who were involved in the dealing in counterfeit dollars in the capital Juba.

Since South Sudan stopped oil production in January over a transit fees dispute with Sudan, the young nation has suffered from rampant inflation and lack of hard currency. This has made importing the goods the young nation depends on such as food from Kenya and Uganda even more difficult. National staff at the United Nations and other agencies went on strike last month demanding to be paid in dollars due to the devaluation of the South Sudanese Pound and the rising cost of living. Oil production is due to begin within four to six months according to officials but the closure has severely stunted the development of the world's youngest nation as it struggles to overcome the consequences of decades of war and underinvestment. Unity State authorities warned foreigners not to spoil the image of new nation committing such crimes, adding that they would be judged, according to the South Sudan Transitional Constitutions. ""For foreigners what I want to tell them, they have to respect themselves because we don't want to involve them to the court or involve them for something bad that would be shameful for their staying in South Sudan"", added Girish.

The compensation is for claims of harassment, confiscation of goods and property, failure of payment for goods and services, injuries, and loss of life during business transactions. The trade dispute arbitration committee handed over a report verifying the claims, and both the South Sudan and Ugandan governments approved the compensation. The trade minister received the report to ensure the resolution of the disputes. Additionally, traders are finding other export destinations, such as Kenya, Rwanda, and DR Congo, because of the difficulties encountered in South Sudan.","The South Sudan government will pay $41m in compensation to members of South Sudan Traders Association Limited (MSTAL) a Ugandan body, which lost their property while trading in Juba. The body claimed harassment, confiscation of goods and property and the failure of the South Sudan government or individuals to pay for goods and services supplied and in some cases injuries and loss of life in the course of business. Among the firms that will be compensated are Aponye Uganda Limited ($8m), Afro Kai Limited ($2.58m), Sunrise and other single claimants who have sought compensation. Many of them have been trading in South Sudan, particularly exporting grain that has largely been on demand. The compensation was revealed on Tuesday when the Trade Dispute Arbitration Committee was handing over a report to Amelia Kyambadde, the trade minister. The committee was tasked with reviewing and verifying trade disputes and claims in South Sudan. Both the South Sudan and the Ugandan governments verified the compensation claims. The South Sudanese have agreed to pay the compensation. The function took place at the ministry's head office on parliament Avenue, Kampala. ""I am delighted to receive the final report today. his report will form a basis for our engagement with the Republic of South Sudan to ensure that these disputes are resolved once and for all,"" Kyambadde said. She added that trade between Uganda and Sudan has been growing steadily. In 2008, Sudan accounted for 14.3% of Uganda's exports, compared to Kenya's 9.5%, Switzerland 9% and Rwanda 7.9% according to Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Many traders report that they are now reluctant to continue trading in South Sudan. The 2010 rankings of Uganda's top markets by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics indicate that trade with South Sudan was relegated from the first position in 2008/9 to fourth in 2010. The leading three export destinations are now Kenya, Rwanda and DR Congo. This seems to suggest that traders are finding other destinations for their products, Kyambadde explained. ""One cannot rule out the possibility that traders are giving a wide berth to South Sudan and preferring export destinations that do not come with difficulties,"" said Kyambadde. She added that the ministry is hopeful that once these claims are settled and the trade environment in South Sudan improves the traders will regain confidence to seek market and investment opportunities in Juba.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,economy,0,1

""We are convinced that this must be the way forward for us to protect ourselves from the scourge of desertification, land degradation and drought,"" he added. Gore said the National Action Programme, which aims to implement the provisions of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), is currently under development and will build on the successes and challenges experienced through the Country Pilot Partner (CPP) Programme. The minister enumerated some achievements from the programme, citing the establishment of new and innovative approaches to agriculture such as conservation farming, as well as community-driven approaches to sustainable land management and community-based rangeland management practices. He pointed out that communities have also been supported to develop enterprises from the sustainable management of natural resources. More than 6 million south Sudan pounds is required to be invested in such projects through the CPP Programme. In spite of all these areas of progress, the minister raised the concern that Government is very much aware of the challenges the country faces. South Sudan experiences drought in 2012, resulting into the huge livestock losses and human suffering. ""I reassure you that the Ministry of Environment and partner ministries in close and full co-operation with our partners and communities are committed to finding lasting solutions to this complex challenge. The long-term sustainable management of our lands will be the key to process and we look forward to implementing new solutions that will emanate from collective efforts"", he said.

The organization has so far received only $42 million of the $108 million it has appealed for. In May, almost one in three South Sudanese faced crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity, and the number is expected to increase to 3.9 million (34% of the total population) during June through August 2014. The FAO urgently needs an additional $66 million to further expand its support and prevent a famine. FAO is working with the World Food Programme and UNICEF to reach some of the most remote communities in the country by transporting emergency livelihood kits via airdrop, airlift, and truck. The composition of the kits and their suitability to the local conditions are essential. The distribution of fuel-efficient stoves will begin in the coming weeks to reduce the risk of sexual violence against women while collecting firewood in remote areas and combat the risk of deforestation. ","Rome — Continued efforts to provide farmers, fishers and pastoralists in South Sudan with life-saving emergency livelihood kits are at risk due to a funding shortfall, aggravating the risk of famine in some areas of the country, FAO warned today. The Organization has so far received $42 million of the $108 million it has appealed for as part of the revised Crisis Response Plan for 2014. Contributions received to date have been used to reach more than 205,000 vulnerable households - over 1.2 million people - with emergency livelihood kits, which contain crop and vegetable seeds, fishing equipment and livestock treatment kits and vaccines for veterinary support. FAO is delivering emergency livelihood support at a pace ten times faster than last year. The Organization has delivered, spent or committed all of the funds it has received, and resources have now run out. FAO urgently needs an additional $66 million in order to further expand its support to help the South Sudanese help themselves through the crisis. ""An additional 2 million people, or 345 000 vulnerable households, can be supported if we receive additional funding,"" said Jeff Tschirley of FAO's Emergency and Rehabilitation Division. ""We must not wait for the current very critical situation to deepen or for a famine to be declared because by then we know that it will be too late for many. We need to act today to save lives and livelihoods."" The FAO Representative in South Sudan and the UN's Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator in the country, Sue Lautze, underlined the importance of the emergency livelihood kits for the country, where up to 95 percent of the population depends on farming, fishing or herding to meet their food and income needs. ""The distribution of the kits provides the means for fishers to fish, farmers to plant and pastoralists to keep their herds healthy, which in turn puts milk, vegetables, meat and fish on the table, and that's been keeping a lot of people alive right now,"" she said. Food insecurity deteriorating In May, some 3.5 million people - almost one in three South Sudanese - were facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity, and the number is expected to increase to 3.9 million (34% of the total population) during June through August 2014. More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes since conflict broke out in the country in mid-December and the situation has been further exacerbated by the onset of the rainy season in June. Meanwhile, violent clashes continue to be reported in some areas despite the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement in May. ""The best means to prevent famine in South Sudan is for the guns to fall silent,"" said Lautze. ""Continued violence is the single most important factor in transforming a risk of famine into a reality."" Looking ahead FAO has been scaling up its operations in South Sudan since March 2014, working with the World Food Programme and UNICEF to reach some of the most remote communities in the country by transporting emergency livelihood kits via airdrop, airlift and truck. So far over 329 000 kits have been distributed thanks to support from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States of America as well as the Africa Solidarity Trust Fund, the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund and FAO's own resources. The composition of the kits and their suitability to the local conditions is essential. FAO is working in close cooperation with logistics partners to ensure that the aid that is delivered can be of immediate support to the population. Distribution of fuel efficient stoves will begin in the coming weeks, aiming to reduce the risk of sexual violence against women while collecting firewood in remote areas and combat the risk of deforestation. ""Camps have sprung up in the middle of nowhere and women are taking horrendous and unacceptable risks in going out of the camps and getting firewood, sometimes walking for hours"" Lautze explained. ""I am incredibly proud of FAO's team in South Sudan right now. They have been working tirelessly since the beginning of the crisis, and many continue to risk their lives to deliver life and livelihood-saving assistance,"" said Lautze. The Organization is also working to prevent the current crisis from escalating into 2015 by ensuring farmers are ready for next year's planting season, pre-positioning seeds, agricultural tools, vaccines and fuel-efficient stoves. ""A thriving agriculture sector is crucial to long-term peace and development in South Sudan,"" Lautze stressed.

"The article discusses a report released by Human Rights Watch, calling on the government of South Sudan to increase efforts to protect girls from child marriage, as close to half of the South Sudanese girls between 15 and 19 are married, with some marrying as young as age 12. Child marriage disrupts or ends a girl's education, increases her risk of violence and abuse, and jeopardizes her health. Failure to combat child marriage is also likely to have serious implications for the future development of South Sudan, Human Rights Watch said. ","The government of South Sudan should increase efforts to protect girls from child marriage, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today, on the eve of International Women's Day. The country's widespread child marriage exacerbates South Sudan's pronounced gender gaps in school enrollment, contributes to soaring maternal mortality rates, and violates the right of girls to be free from violence, and to marry only when they are able and willing to give their free consent. According to government statistics, close to half (48 percent) of South Sudanese girls between 15 and 19 are married, with some marrying as young as age 12. The 95-page report, ""'This Old Man Can Feed Us, You Will Marry Him:' Child and Forced Marriage in South Sudan,"" documents the consequences of child marriage, the near total lack of protection for victims who try to resist marriage or leave abusive marriages, and the many obstacles they face in accessing mechanisms of redress. It is based on interviews with 87 girls and women in Central Equatoria, Western Equatoria, and Jonglei states, as well as with government officials, traditional leaders, health care workers, legal and women's rights experts, teachers, prison officials, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, the United Nations, and donor organizations. ""Girls who have the courage to refuse early marriages are in dire need of protection, support, and education,"" said Liesl Gerntholtz, women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. ""The South Sudan government must make sure that there is a coordinated government response to cases of child marriage and more training for police and prosecutors on the right of girls to protection."" Girls told Human Rights Watch of being pressured to marry by family members anxious to receive dowry payments, or because they were suspected of pre-marital sex. One girl, Ageer M. told Human Rights Watch, ""I refused him but they beat me badly and took me by force to him. The man forced me to have sex with him so I had to stay there."" Few girls in South Sudan know they have the right to seek help, while girls who try to resist early and forced marriages suffer brutal consequences at the hands of their families - including verbal abuse and physical assault, and sometimes even murder. The Human Rights Watch report tells the story of a 17-year-old girl studying in Lakes State whose father tried to force her to marry an old man who had offered a dowry of 200 cows to her family. The girl refused and said, ""I don't know this man. I have never spoken to him, and he is not my age."" The girl was taken to a nearby forest, tied to a tree and beaten until she died. The report recommends that the government clearly set 18 as the minimum age for marriage; ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (CRC), and other human rights treaties; and pass comprehensive family legislation on marriage, separation, and divorce. Child marriage disrupts or ends a girl's education, increases her risk of violence and abuse, and jeopardizes her health. Failure to combat child marriage is also likely to have serious implications for the future development of South Sudan, Human Rights Watch said. It constrains the education, health, security, and economic progress of women and girls, their families, and their communities. ""Child marriage frequently interrupts girls' education - or deprives them of it altogether,"" Gerntholtz said. Girls and women interviewed said that dreams of continuing school to become accountants, teachers, or doctors were cut short when they married. Those who dropped out of school found it difficult to continue after marriage or becoming pregnant. Government statistics for 2011 show that only 39 percent of primary school students and 30 percent of secondary students are female. Child marriage also puts girls at greater risk of death or ill-health because of early pregnancy and childbirth. Reproductive health studies show that young women face greater risks in pregnancy and child birth than older women, including life-threatening obstructed labour due to their smaller pelvises and immature bodies - problems accentuated by South Sudan's limited prenatal and postnatal healthcare services. Human Rights Watch called on the South Sudanese government, with the support of its development partners, to: Develop and implement a comprehensive national action plan to prevent and address the consequences of child marriage; Develop and implement guidelines on how national and state level government ministries and agencies should handle child marriage cases; Conduct training for relevant government and law enforcement officials about the legal rights of girls under the Child Act, particularly their right to be protected from child marriage; Carry out a nationwide awareness-raising campaign to inform the public about the harms caused by child marriage; Work toward comprehensive reform of South Sudan's laws on marriage, separation, divorce, and related matters; and Take programmatic and policy measures to ensure that girls and women who seek help to fight forced marriages can receive it. Worldwide, some 14 million girls are married before their 18th birthday every year. A 2012 report by UNICEF shows that around one in three women aged 20-24 years were married before they reached 18 years of age, and around 11 percent entered into marriage before 15 years of age. Child marriage occurs in practically every region of the world but occurs at higher rates in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. ""The global problem of child marriage strips women and girls of their livelihoods and creates a high risk of violence,"" Gerntholtz said. ""South Sudan's government must make good on its pledges of gender equality by putting human rights of women and girls at the heart of its development agenda.""

"The article discusses the outbreak of cholera in Juba, South Sudan and the urgent need for donor funding to respond to the humanitarian crisis. The UN has revised its appeal for South Sudan, which currently stands at 1.8 billion USD until December 2014. The rainy season is cutting off humanitarian access and increasing the risk of disease, and donor funding is critical to saving lives in the region.","As rains cut off humanitarian access and increase risk of the spread of disease, increased donor funding is critical to saving lives in South Sudan The people of South Sudan, already exposed to conflict and hunger, are this week facing a new threat - cholera. The outbreak of the highly contagious disease in Juba ahead of tomorrow's donor pledging conference in Oslo, organised by Norway and the United Nations, demonstrates how urgently funds are needed to respond to the increasingly dire humanitarian crisis unfolding in the world's newest nation. Oxfam's South Sudan country director Cecilia Milan who is in Oslo, said: ""The confirmation of 138 cholera cases in Juba is a stark reminder of the multitude of risks the citizens of this country have been forced to endure since conflict broke out in December 2013. There is no question - the international community must act now to prevent a rapidly escalating food crisis - and now potentially a public health emergency - in South Sudan."" Urban areas and camps, at most risk Cholera is spread through contaminated water, human interaction and unclean food, so the often overcrowded urban, camp and settlement areas are most at risk. If untreated, the highly contagious disease can have up to a 50 percent fatality rate, but if treated, this is dramatically reduced to less than 1 percent. Prevention and treatment measures are simple, but with aid budgets for South Sudan already desperately underfunded, lives stand to be lost because responders lack the funds they need to react rapidly to this outbreak. Milan said: ""The people of South Sudan have already suffered too much - so many lives have been lost to conflict and so many more stand to be lost due to hunger. We can't morally sit by and watch a public health crisis take additional lives in South Sudan. The humanitarian responders stand ready to do what is needed to avert a hunger and disease catastrophe in South Sudan. But we need donors to stand behind us and give vital funding to enable us to carry out our work."" The UN has revised its appeal for South Sudan, which now stands at 1.8 billion USD until December 2014. Currently, only 515 million USD has been received. The UN has projected that by December, 4 million people will go hungry, 7 million will be in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, 1.5 million will be displaced within South Sudan, and over 850,000 will have fled to neighbouring countries. In addition to asking donors to to pledge funds at the Oslo conference, Oxfam is calling on the general public to donate generously to its emergency appeal. Humanitarian access, protection of civilians and more resources: key issues at Oslo The Oslo conference centres around four core areas: humanitarian access, protection of civilians, regional response for refugees, and the resources required to adequately respond. If all four of these areas are not addressed within the coming months, the victims of this conflict risk being pushed into hunger crisis of catastrophic proportions. With the onset of the rainy season, roads and rivers become impassable, making access to affected communities almost impossible and creating perfect conditions for further spread of disease. Donor countries and regional neighbours must also use their diplomatic channels to ensure the current ceasefire holds, for without an end to the conflict, conditions will only worsen, pushing thousands more from their homes and hindering the provision of life-saving humanitarian aid. Oxfam's humanitarian response Oxfam has so far helped over 180,000 people in South Sudan and 63,000 in Uganda, working to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases by providing access to clean water and sanitation, and providing household items such as mosquito nets, blankets, cook stoves and charcoal for cooking. Oxfam also supports peace building initiatives in communities where it is working, both in South Sudan and Uganda. It plans to expand its work to help many more but needs to find the funds to do so. In response to the cholera outbreak in Juba, Oxfam is building latrines (only 15 percent of people in South Sudan have access to latrines), providing buckets, treating water, mobilising communities to collect garbage and communicating good hygiene practices to these communities to reduce the spread of the disease. With a quick response, it is hoped that the outbreak can be contained.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,demographics,-1,-1

"The article discusses the humanitarian and medical situation in South Sudan, including violence-related trauma, disease outbreaks, food insecurity, and lack of healthcare access. MSF is responding with regular healthcare projects and emergency teams in various locations within the country.","Terri Morris has been working as a head of mission for MSF in South Sudan for the last nine months. Ahead of the formal declaration of independence, due on July 9, she gave an overview of the medical and humanitarian situation in what will soon be the newest country in the world. What is the current situation in the country? ""South Sudan is experiencing a massive humanitarian emergency: the people have acute needs now and will continue to do so in the coming years. The situation is already critical in terms of the availability of healthcare. Added to this, the civilian population has borne the brunt of emergency after emergency: regular, violent clashes resulting in death, injury and mass displacement; the arrival of 300,000 people returning from the north; and chronic malnutrition and frequent outbreaks of diseases such as kala azar, measles and meningitis. The humanitarian response to these repeated crises has often been complicated and delayed. Prevailing logistical challenges make it difficult to reach people and provide lifesaving assistance. ""Since February, 2011, there has been a marked increase in violent clashes in South Sudan and the contested border areas between North and South Sudan. This has resulted in an increase in the number of violence-related trauma patients, some of whom are being treated in MSF's medical facilities, but too many people in need of care - often the most vulnerable, including women and children not suffering directly from violence-related trauma - never make it to a medical facility. ""The heightened hostility between both sides and violent attacks by the North in contested border areas [Abyei, South Kordofan, and similar patterns of violence on the border between South Darfur and Western Bahr El Ghazal] is making media headlines In the lead-up to the South's independence from the North. However, other violence has also claimed lives and displaced people this year, but has rarely made it into the news. This includes intertribal/communal related violence, cattle raiding and the rise of new southern militias."" What are the consequences of the violence and insecurity? ""The violence has taken a massive toll on the civilian population, causing to death and displacement in states across South Sudan. An estimated 210,000 people were displaced by violence in South Sudan in 2010. 1 ""In Western Equatoria state, for example, at least 18 incidents related to the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) have resulted in abduction, death or displacement in 2011, creating fear and anxiety among communities who are already struggling with high burdens of disease, limited access to basic services and an uncertain economic future due to the disruption to their farming cycles. ""Insecurity increases vulnerability to disease - particularly communicable diseases and malnutrition - and further restricts people's access to healthcare. It prevents many people from travelling to seek treatment, whether it is for violence-related injuries or for another medical problem. The various levels of insecurity also affect supply routes, hampering not only trade but also the delivery of drugs and medical supplies."" What is the health context in South Sudan? ""In Sudan, 75 per cent of people do not have access to even basic healthcare. Critical gaps remain for basic medical services, and particularly for emergencies. Currently, more than 80 per cent of healthcare available in South Sudan is provided by international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). ""While the context is rapidly changing - a Ministry of Health is being established and there has been a marked influx of NGOs - it will take the government of South Sudan many years to establish a functioning health system that can meet the needs of its people. ""The extreme shortage of trained, skilled health workers in South Sudan is a major concern. MSF is investigating how it could play a role in improving the situation. For example, in Yambio county, in addition the usual training we offer South Sudanese staff working with MSF, we are focusing on malaria. We are training local health staff in rural health centres, donating medical supplies and providing on-site support and supervision to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of simple malaria. People with severe and complicated malaria are referred to Yambio state hospital, where MSF provides free healthcare to pregnant women and children - the groups most at risk from severe malaria."" What are the health needs in the country? ""Women and children are the most vulnerable to the lack of access to healthcare. South Sudan has one of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world. Many women in labour have to walk for hours or even days to reach a health facility. If they make it, it is often too late. ""Food insecurity is increasing. The seasonal hunger gap started in May, and this year the levels of malnutrition are expected to be higher than last year because of violence and insecurity. 2 More people will need access to limited food supplies, including over 300,000 returnees 3 as well as the 210,000 people displaced by conflict. In addition, food and fuel prices are rising for several reasons, including blockages of routes from the north. ""Malaria is endemic in South Sudan and hyperendemic in Western Equatoria state. In 2011, MSF has already treated more than 10,000 people for malaria."" Are there a lot of returnees coming back from North Sudan? ""An estimated 300,000 people have returned to South Sudan - the influx appears to have slowed since the referendum in January. These people are particularly vulnerable. They tend to have poor immunity to diseases such as kala azar and are at increased risk of sexual violence. They are also in a difficult socio-economic position, as they face problems accessing and cultivating land."" What is MSF's response to the situation? ""As well as running its regular basic and specialist healthcare projects with a specific focus on maternal health and on children under 15, this year MSF has also sent emergency teams to assist people wounded or displaced by violence in Malakal (Upper Nile state), Bentiu (Unity state), Akon (Warrap state), Bor (Jonglei state) and Mvolo, Gangura and Tambura (Western Equatoria state). These teams have set up regular mobile clinics to ensure that displaced people living in remote areas can access healthcare. They have carried out measles vaccinations and distributed relief items and emergency food rations. ""In this humanitarian emergency, MSF will continue to provide essential medical aid where the needs are greatest, and where we can be of most relevance and benefit to the population. Improving access to healthcare and improving its emergency response has to be a priority for this new country. However, the government of South Sudan has allocated just 3.7 per cent of its budget to health in 2011, a decrease from 7.9 per cent in 2006. It is essential that emergency humanitarian needs are adequately prioritised by the South Sudanese government, by donor governments and by international humanitarian NGOs."" Currently, MSF runs 13 regular projects across eight out of the ten states of southern Sudan, providing a range of services, including basic and specialist healthcare, responding to emergencies as they arise, nutritional support, reproductive healthcare, treatment for kala azar, counselling services, surgery, and paediatric and obstetric care.
