The South Sudan Red Cross has provided temporary shelter but donations are not enough.

The health center that was flooded served more than 350 families, and Raja County Commissioner Hassan Jalaab Khadaam said the county does not have the money to repair it. South Sudan Red Cross state chairman Leon Archangelo said no one died in the flooding a week ago on Tuesday, but warned that families without shelter faced an increased risk of disease, especially malaria, which is transmitted by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water. The Red Cross has provided temporary shelter to families made homeless by the flooding, but was limited in how far its help would stretch. ""Frankly speaking, the donations we have are not enough, based on the reality on the ground,"" Archangelo said. ""We gave them only shelter assistance. But in general these people might need food items because their farms will not produce the products that they were expecting or some of the farms will not produce at all,"" he said. Relief crews have been working to make the roads leading to the county passable again, so that trucks can carry aid to the area without getting bogged down, officials said.",NEGATIVE,,hunger,-1,-1
"The article discusses the plight of several hundred citizens from Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia who are currently among the 100,000 civilians holed up in UN bases in Juba, South Sudan since fighting broke out in mid-December 2013 between supporters and opponents of President Salva Kiir. These foreign nationals have lost the means to resume their precarious lives in the world's youngest nation, and so cannot return to their home countries for fear of persecution or imprisonment. The fate of the foreigners is an extra headache for government officials and relief agencies trying to assist nearly 1.5 million others displaced by the violence.","Juba — Among the 100,000 civilians holed up in UN bases in South Sudan since fighting broke out in mid-December 2013 between supporters and opponents of President Salva Kiir are several hundred citizens from Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia. Many have lost the means to resume their precarious lives in the world's youngest nation, and so cannot return to their home countries for fear of persecution or imprisonment. The fate of the foreigners is an extra headache for government officials and relief agencies trying to assist nearly 1.5 million others displaced by the violence. Aid workers warn that famine will strike some areas of South Sudan in the coming months unless more humanitarian assistance is provided. South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, remains one of the world's poorest countries. However, it had been enjoying an economic boom fuelled by oil revenues and international development assistance, and had attracted thousands of investors, traders and labourers from across eastern Africa. Many hotels and restaurants in Juba are owned by Eritreans, who are also said to dominate the water trucking business in many cities. Somalis are said to be prominent in supplying fuel. Officials say many foreign workers lack official residency or work permits, while the Commission for Refugee Affairs is still establishing itself. After fighting broke out in December, the governments of Kenya and Uganda sent planes to evacuate their stranded nationals. Uganda used the need to protect its citizens to partly justify its deployment of troops to secure the capital and prop up Kiir's government. Sara Basha of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said it had helped repatriate more than 100 other foreigners to their home countries, including many Sudanese citizens. IOM brought the foreigners to Juba, from where the evacuees' embassies were responsible for their onward transport. However, she said some embassies lacked the funds to send their citizens back home. ""So even if we bring them to Juba we are just moving them from one location to another and there is no solution for them,"" Barra told IRIN. Many of those in the IDP camp at UN House, the world body's main compound in Juba, say they have no wish to be repatriated. Eritreans Simon Tesfazghi, a leader of the 250 Eritreans he said lived in the camp, said he had fled Eritrea in 2013 after seven years of gruelling military service. Another reason was that Eritrean authorities did not allow him to practice his Protestant faith freely, he said. Tesfazghi said it was unthinkable for the Eritreans to go back to their country, or to return to South Sudanese towns such as Bor and Bentiu, which were destroyed in the fighting and where foreigners had been harassed and robbed by gunmen from both sides. He said his community would like to be recognized as refugees and taken to another country. ""How long will we have to sit here? We are foreigners, not citizens of this country. Who can find a solution for us?"" John Dabi, deputy commissioner for refugee affairs, said the South Sudanese government acknowledged that the Eritreans could not easily return home. The UN's top human rights body last month launched an investigation into alleged abuses in Eritrea, including extrajudicial executions, torture and forced military conscription. The USA has long listed Eritrea as a ""Country of Particular Concern"" for its ""particularly severe"" violations of religious freedom. Dabi said that after the crisis in South Sudan began he wrote to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, proposing that Eritreans living in the UN camps be granted ""temporary protection"" while a mechanism was established to examine their individual cases. Under laws passed in 2012, South Sudan currently only recognizes refugees from particular areas of Sudan, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. But Dabi said the temporary protection plan was hastily put on ice after it triggered rumours that swept through the Eritrean and other foreign communities that they would be granted refugee status and resettled in the USA, prompting a deluge of new registrations at the camp. ""Everyone came running in and claiming the same status,"" Dabi told IRIN. ""If it is just a handful of people - 80 or 100 - you can deal with it, but if you are talking of several thousand it becomes difficult to manage... They all wanted to get into a third country as soon as possible."" He said the plan to grant the Eritreans temporary protection would be revisited only once the Commission and UNHCR had established a committee to determine applicants' eligibility for refugee status. But there were no plans to do this for Ethiopians or Somalis. Ethiopians One of the displaced, Farouk Kedir, said many of the 160 Ethiopians in the camp at UN House had fled to South Sudan for political reasons. He said Ethiopian authorities had left them alone while they were living unobtrusively in provincial towns, but that grouping them together in Juba had drawn unwanted attention. ""Now that we are all together here, [it is easier to] follow us more closely,"" Kedir told IRIN. He claimed that three people from the community who had ventured outside the camp had been kidnapped, and another killed by unidentified attackers. A group of four men had come to their section of the camp a month earlier and begun taking photographs of the displaced people, Kedir said. Residents challenged them and a scuffle broke out before the men fled. ""We can't go outside to run our businesses as we did before,"" Kedir said. ""And we cannot go back to Ethiopia. We would be killed or imprisoned."" He said community leaders had reported their situation to UN officials, and asked the world body to take them to ""any"" safe country. Somalis Abdul Aziz Ismail, a Somali community leader, said there were 300 Somalis at UN House. He said some of them had been in South Sudan for over 20 years, having fled from the long wars racking their home country. ""We were already displaced. Now we are displaced again, but nobody is taking any notice,"" Ismail said in an interview in a makeshift tea-shop in the camp, flanked by dozens of his compatriots. ""We don't want to be here, using stinking latrines and begging for everything."" He said it was dangerous for any man to return to Somalia. ""If you come from the outside, people will think you are a spy. They will take you away and behead you."" ""Beggars have no choices. If we had a choice, we would have taken it. Now we do not know what we should do."" Ismail said foreigners who left the camp tended to draw the attention of nervous South Sudanese security forces. The fact that many lacked official documents left them vulnerable to harassment, abuse and extortion, he said. Still, he said hundreds of Somalis had left the camp as the situation in Juba had stabilized, particularly those with businesses and support networks in the capital. Dabi argued that many more of the foreigners in the camps would be safe to do likewise. ""Nobody is targeting them. They can go back to whatever business they were doing before,"" he said. South Sudanese authorities had no plans to expel foreigners inside their borders, or to tax their business activities, he said. In the meantime, Dabi said foreign civilians should be granted the same assistance as displaced South Sudanese. While the focus is currently on protection, he said there were discussions under way with international partners about how to help people restore their livelihoods.

Humanitarian officials predict that the number of South Sudanese seeking shelter in Ethiopia may double - or more - by the year's end.","Tens of thousands of refugees from South Sudan are pouring into Ethiopia, fleeing the fighting in their homeland. By the end of the year, officials say Ethiopia could be hosting some 150,000 South Sudanese refugees. WFP is distributing food rations to refugees in camps and border crossings, along with special, nutrient-packed foods for the most vulnerable. But the sheer numbers of new arrivals are straining the resources of the humanitarian community. KULE REFUGEE CAMP, Ethiopia - Nyanhial Moun, 18, squats next to a bag of US-donated sorghum, a fleeting smile on her worried face. She will share the grain, along with the vegetable oil, pulses, salt and sugar that WFP has also distributed today, with two other women. Their shared hardships of loss and hunger under a searing sun has produced a strong desire to help each other. Like many of the tens of thousands of South Sudanese refugees who have poured into western Ethiopia in recent weeks, Moun fled the fighting that erupted in her country in mid-December. It took two weeks walking through the bush before she crossed a muddy creek into Ethiopia at the entry point of Pagak. From there, she was transferred to this refugee camp. ""I don't know where I am,"" says Moun, who hails from Malakal, the capital of South Sudan's Upper Nile state. ""I just arrived here. My family is scattered."" Variations of Moun's story are recounted by many of these refugees at Kule. Most are women and children who arrive here exhausted and famished, having eating little more than leaves, wild fruit and handouts from fellow countrymen along the way. Children at risk ""I came here to eat,"" says Nyaluak Chol, 31, as she cradles her listless toddler. Chol reached Ethiopia with three children after a 270-kilometre trek from her home in Upper Nile state. Two other children and her husband are unaccounted for. ""We're staying until things get better,"" she says. The influx of new arrivals is straining the capacities of humanitarian agencies and the Ethiopian government. Some of the weakest and youngest children have died of a lethal mix of malnutrition, measles, malaria and respiratory infections. ""Children are arriving in the camps in a very worrying condition, and there are alarmingly high levels of malnutrition,"" says WFP's acting Country Director Purnima Kashyap, who visited the region this past week as part of a humanitarian delegation who came to assess the situation. WFP has been distributing food rations at the refugee camps and some border points since the crisis erupted in December. The new arrivals also receive high-energy biscuits, and the most fragile - children under 5, pregnant women and nursing mothers - receive special, nutrient-packed food supplements. ""I would say the situation has improved since WFP began the supplementary feeding programme,"" Kashyap adds. ""But the dramatic increase of people seeking refuge in Ethiopia is having an impact on the resources we have. We will need more resources very rapidly over the coming months."" More to come At the nearby border crossing of Pagak, thousands more South Sudanese wait to be bussed to Kule camp. Another camp, Leitchor, with a capacity to host 20,000 refugees, is bursting at the seams. Today, more than 30,000 South Sudanese are living there, and officials are scrambling to expand it. ""These people are coming here because they have problems. They are our brothers and sisters,"" says Ayalew Awoke, deputy head of Ethiopia's Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA). Unless peace takes hold in South Sudan, these asylum seekers may keep pouring in. Today, humanitarian officials predict the number of South Sudanese seeking shelter in Ethiopia may double - or more - by the year's end. The food is a lifeline for now. But very soon, the rains will arrive, turning roads into muddy tracks that will hamper delivery of humanitarian assistance. And for many of these South Sudanese, who celebrated their country's independence just three years ago, it's hard to look ahead. ""The 21-year-old conflict destroyed everything,"" says 33-year-old Gatuoth Bithow, who worked for the government's disarmament commission before fleeing to Ethiopia. ""Now, people are dying of malaria and other sicknesses. We need help - as soon as possible.""",NEGATIVE,,refugees,1,1

The war ended in 2005 with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the former rebels the Sudan Liberation Movement (SPLM) and Sudan's ruling National Congress Party (NCP). South Sudan became independent on 9 July after the 98 percent of its people voted for secession in plebiscite granted by the CPA. Sudan revoked the citizenship of all South Sudanese after independence but was persuaded by the international community to allow a nine month grace period, which ended in April.

""Thanks to donors, this CHF allocation allows humanitarian partners to hit the ground running from 1 January,"" said Toby Lanzer, the Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan. ""However, it is only 10 per cent of the $600 million we need by the end of February if we are to save more lives and reach all people in acute need in early 2015,"" he continued.

"The article discusses the challenges faced by people living in Minkamen, a settlement in South Sudan that has grown rapidly due to conflict. The poor state of the roads makes it difficult to deliver supplies, and the hard clay subsoil causes issues with drainage. The Red Cross is preparing for the rainy season by raising toilets above large containers to prevent overflow and the spread of disease. Many people are sick and in need of medical assistance, and the area is in dire need of aid during this difficult time. The article also tells the story of Diing, a Red Cross volunteer who was abducted as a child and scarred with marks of another tribe. He and his fellow aid workers have had to flee violence themselves, but are dedicated to helping those in need.","We are up early this morning to set off for Minkamen, the biggest settlement site in South Sudan for people forced from their homes due to the ongoing conflict. The place has expanded from a small village of 7,000 to a town of over 90,000, with new arrivals coming every day. Getting supplies to these people is difficult; the poor state of the road means it takes two days for a truck to get there, even though the distance is only 150 kilometres. Fortunately, we get a ride on a Red Cross helicopter that is delivering aid supplies and personnel to the site. From the air you get a clear idea of how barren the country is and how few roads there are. Forty minutes later, the settlement area comes into view. It is on the River Nile. What strikes you most is the sheer, sprawling extent of it. A volunteer from the South Sudan Red Cross awaits us, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross. I notice he has scars on his forehead, four straight lines, which I assume must be tribal markings. I will come back to these later. Upon arrival, it soon becomes clear how difficult life is for these families. There are puddles and mud everywhere. The hard, clay subsoil makes it hard for the water to drain away. Our ATV gets stuck. Trucks get stuck. And this is even before the rainy season has really begun. The Red Cross is busily preparing for the rainy season. About 300 toilets will be raised above large, dug-in containers. This is to prevent the toilets from overflowing, which would result in excrement running out among all the temporary huts, with all the hazards that would bring, such as outbreaks of diarrhoea. This can be deadly, especially for children. I notice a naked child playing by a toilet that has already overflowed, flies crawling around his eyes. We explain to his parents that this is not a good idea. A mother of four tells me that many people are already sick. Her daughters have diarrhoea, but she has no money to buy medicine. They do have food, but it is a monotonous diet. As we arrive, a big supply tent is being erected so they can get essential aid to help them survive the rainy season. In the evening, I get talking with Diing, the South Sudan Red Cross volunteer who collected us from the airstrip, the man with the scars on his forehead. This 25-year-old aid worker comes from nearby Bor, on the other side of the river. He fled to a village further away, while over 50,000 others narrowly escaped with their lives by crossing the river in boats. Many of the people who stayed behind, most of them elderly, were killed. The first days were hell, says Diing. For days on end, people had nothing to eat. There was no help for the wounded and nowhere to sleep. On top of all that, it was hot, well over 40 degrees Celsius. After four days, relief came from the Red Cross. With other Red Cross volunteers, Diing worked around the clock to help those in greatest need. It was not easy, because everyone needed help. People in surrounding villages are also in dire straits. In recent months, the Red Cross has provided not only food for over 10,000 people in Minkamen and the surrounding area, but also cooking equipment, clean water and tarpaulins to protect the huts against the rain. However, another Red Cross aid worker says the work is still not finished by a long shot. I ask Diing if this is the first time he has had to flee the violence. Then, unexpectedly, comes the explanation of the scars on his forehead. It turns out to be a moving story. At the age of four, Diing was abducted by an armed band. With a knife, they cut marks deeply into his forehead. It was the symbol of another tribe. For four years, Diing did not see his parents, and was taken in by a family who regarded him as their son. Eventually, his parents were able to trace him. They demanded the return of their son and threatened vengeance.

The Blue Nile state welcomed an infantry battalion from Marawi and is expected to receive two additional battalions. The African Union mediation has convened a meeting on 15 March for political negotiations to end the conflict in the two areas.,"Khartoum — Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) have dispatched more troops to the Blue Nile following recent clashes in the eastern Sudan state with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM-N) near the strategic town of Kurmuk on the border with Ethiopia. SAF launched recently an attack on the SPLM-N's positions in Mafo, located at about 20 kilometres southwest of Kurmuk but the rebels repulsed the attack and followed the Sudanese troops to the outskirts of the border town. The Blue Nile state welcomed the infantry battalion (931) which arrived from Marawi, northern Sudan, in the context of strengthening the state security, reported the semi official Sudanese Media Centre on Friday. The new service which is close to the intelligence service, further said that two additional battalions are expected to arrive in the coming days. It added that the Blue Nile state has launched a campaign to recruit new troops with the participation of the state leadership of the executive, legislative and political organs. Informed sources told Sudan Tribune that most of the Sudanese army soldiers killed in the attack on Mafo were from the Blue Nile. The SPLM said they killed about 86 soldiers during the clashes.

"The article discusses the increasing militant threats from Sudan's President Omar Al Bashir regarding regions disputed with South Sudan. President Bashir threatened war at a pro-government rally in Blue Nile State and accused South Sudan of funding and supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, currently fighting the Sudanese army over control of disputed border regions. This violent language is worrying given the numerous issues that the two countries need to tackle together, including border demarcations, visa issues and the division of oil revenues.","After a decades-long civil war was finally resolved with the secession of the south, you'd think Sudan would be ready for a little peace and quiet. Instead, Khartoum is threatening to re-ignite the conflict over an increasingly violent border dispute. The rhetoric from Sudan is getting more militant as conflict escalates in regions disputed with the now-independent South Sudan. Sudan's President Omar Al Bashir made his threat explicit at a pro-government rally in Blue Nile State, which is one of the disputed regions. ""We tell our brothers in the south that if they want peace, we want peace. If they want war, our army is there,"" he told the crowd. ""Our message to our brothers in the south is this: you won the south not because you were victorious, but because of an agreement and a pledge we upheld, so you had better stay in your place."" Sudan has accused South Sudan of funding and supporting the northern branch of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, which became the main opposition in the north after the secession of the south. The SPLM-N is an offshoot of South Sudan's ruling party (so these accusations might not be too far off the mark), and is currently fighting a bitter battle with the Sudanese army over control of disputed border regions. This was reiterated in comments made by Bashir's presidential aide Nafie Ali Nafie. He declared Sudan would ""negotiate with the SPLM in the only language they understand the language of war."" Nafie is not just any presidential aide; he's a hardliner with a nasty reputation for torture, and has the ear of the president. Khartoum's violent language is a worrying development given the parlous relations between the north and the south, and the many issues they are supposed to be tackling together, such as border demarcations, visa issues and, most importantly, the division of oil revenues.DM",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,conflict,-1,-1
"The article discusses South Sudan's vice-president Riek Machar urging state governments to prepare for a conference on national reconciliation and healing among communities and leaders in South Sudan. Machar blames the mental and physical barriers among communities on the decades of war with the present Sudan and its resulting internal conflicts within South Sudan. The initiative by the government aims to make the nation reconcile with its past, ensuring that bitterness should not be allowed to carry on to the next generation. The event takes place in Juba, with the upcoming April 2013 conference being organized by the Office of the President and the Initiative of Change participating in the same process in South Sudan.","Juba — South Sudan's vice-president, Riek Machar, on Thursday urged the leaderships of the state governments to prepare the ground for the upcoming conference on national reconciliation and healing among the communities and leaders in South Sudan. Leaders of SPLM join their hands following successful reconciliation between John Garang and Salva Kiir in Rumbek, Dec. 1, 2004 (ST) According to the vice-president's press secretary, James Gatdet Dak, he said Machar reiterated the need for the national reconciliation during a meeting with governors and speakers of the state assemblies on the sideline of the post-independence 2nd Governors' Forum at the Freedom Hall in Juba on Thursday. The vice-president briefed the state leaders about the initiative by the government to make the nation reconcile with its past, adding that the bitterness should not be allowed to carry on to the next generation. Machar blamed the situation on the decades of war with the present Sudan and its resulting internal conflicts within South Sudan, saying such conflicts caused mental and physical barriers among the communities. This, he said, has also affected the inter-marriages between tribes which used to be a practice by the older generation. Machar recalled a sample research he made during his visits to Lakes state during which nobody from the younger generation including youth in the cattle camps told him he got married to a Nuer girl. Only people from the older generation of the Dinka tribe of about 50 years of age said they got married to Nuer ladies. When he asked why the youth didn't get married to Nuer girls, the young men replied that during the war there were no more inter-communal meeting points of youth across the communal borders where young men across could have a chance to court girls from the other side since communities became rivals and enemies, they told Machar. Machar further recalled that during those good old days a Nuer or Dinka man would fluently speak and even sing songs in the other's language in the process of courting the girls. ""We need to break this barrier,"" Machar told the state leaders. Leaders in South Sudan are known for their reconciling spirit after political differences. Examples include the reconciliation between Machar and the late leader, John Garang, in 2002 in Nairobi, which resulted to the merger of their forces after the 1991 political split. Another successful reconciliation was between the late leader John Garang and the current president of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, in Rumbek in November 2004, when a conflict emerged between the two over the running of the movement. Machar told the state leaders that the current barriers caused by the lingering wars in minds even after independence was attained should be addressed and overcome, urging them to prepare the ground for the reconciliation. The Office of the President through the Presidential advisor for decentralization, Tor Deng Mawien, will organize the upcoming April 2013 conference and its subsequent campaigns in the states. It will also establish the necessary communications with all the stakeholders at all levels of government. A renowned international organization, the Initiative of Change, which is known for intervening in such reconciliation processes around the world, will also participate in the similar process in South Sudan. The vice-president of the Initiative of Change, Edward Peter, an Australian-born British, was present with his team during the Thursday meeting in Juba. Edward in his remarks during the meeting expressed his organization's readiness to assist in the reconciliation process in the country, which will bring on board famous international personalities including the South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,conflict,1,1
"The article discusses the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, which has resulted in the deaths of many people, including women and children who were fleeing the violence. The conflict started in Juba and has spread to several other states. The fighting is between two leaders, and the article questions the objective of the war. The article suggests that a neutral caretaking government should be put in place to heal the wounds and impartially conduct the coming elections.","In the words of Joseph Omwenga, a Kenyan who wrote in the Daily Nation of January 16th, 2014, ""The ferry tragedy in which 200 people fleeing the South Sudan Conflict drowned was unfortunate. I can imagine what was going on in women and children's minds when the ferry capsized: Why us? Death stared at them arrogantly before they bade life goodbye. Hard as I try, I failed to capture vividly the grotesque picture of children and women drowning in the Nile. They were escaping death by guns, but died by drowning. It is a deafening call to the world."" That is how someone from outside South Sudan described what happened to at least 200 people, mostly children and women fleeing the fighting in Malakal, the capital of Upper Nile state, drowned on Tuesday 14th January as their vessel capsized on the White Nile. Besides this tragedy, the International Crisis Group and other aid agencies estimate that up to10,000 people have been killed in the fighting, which started in Juba, the capital of South Sudan on 15th December, 2014 and spread to three states of Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile, which are the birthplaces of Nuer community to which Dr Riek Machar belongs. The UN says 65,000 people have taken refuge in UN camps across the country and more than 430,000 have been displaced internally or fled the neighbouring countries as refugees. The above figures do not include those who left to the country side and other safer places. Juba has now lost about 70% of its population. Many have decided to go to their home villages or live as urban refugees in Kenya and Uganda. All most all foreigners have left the country. Although Mr Joseph Omwenga was right to call it ""a deafening call to the world"", it should be first and foremost a deafening call to the belligerents of the conflict. The country is burning; people are being killed and displaced in thousands; the historic towns of Bor, Bentiu and Mayom have been completely razed down; yet these happenings don't touch the conscience and moral authority of the so-called leaders who are indulged in the execution of this senseless and objectiveless war. Though wars and conflicts are parts of human nature, they occur and are being engaged in for a noble cause. For example when people of South Sudan engaged themselves in lengthy and destructive wars with northern Sudan for decades, the objective was very clear for the whole world to see. It was a war of liberation-a just war. But what is this war for?! For those who have been closely following the political events in South Sudan, it is all about power struggle between two individuals. What if these two people, for example, succumb to the laws of nature (God forbids), will South Sudan stay without someone who can lead the system of government? According to the explanation given by the government side of President Salva Kiir, the conflict resulted from ""attempted"" coup. Underline the word attempted. For Dr Riek Machar, the fighting erupted accidentally among the members of presidential guards unit, but it took tribal lines between Dinka and Nuer soldiers, and as such it wasn't a coup. Underline the word accidentally. Why the fight took tribal lines should be left for the investigators to establish. If something was attempted or did happen accidentally, it should have been treated as such and normalcy maintained at all cost, because war is destructive and should have been avoided at all cost. However, the crisis in Juba did not end with members of presidential guards unit. It spread into residential areas and some members of Nuer community were targeted and killed. This angered Nuer soldiers and civilians alike in the places where they are the majority. In these places Dinka people were targeted and killed. Fortunately, Dinka people didn't retaliate in the places where they are the majority. Nuer people in Dinka lands were spared except in one case where a Nuer army officer was killed with two body guards by a single soldier whose relative was killed on the other side. Some Dinka people were also spared on Nuer sides through protection from personal friends. To compound the problem, a division commander called Peter Gadet, a Nuer, rebelled in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state. He ransacked the town and declared his allegiance to Dr Machar. Another General by name James Koang, who also hails from Nuer, did the same thing in Bentiu, the capital of Unity state. General Peter Gadet was later reinforced by 25,000 from the so called Jiesh-mbor (white-army), a group of armed youth, from greater Akobo who were mobilised by a Nuer prophet. This huge force enabled Gadet to reclaim Bor from pro-government forces after he had lost it for few days. This situation compelled the government to fight back in order to impose it authority all over the country. The pro-government forces have reclaimed Bentiu and Mayom with heavy losses, on the two sides, in both humans and materials. According to pictures shown by a satellite, the two towns have been razed to ground zero. Similar skirmishes took place in and around the town of Malakal, the capital of Upper Nile state. Fighting occurred between government forces and their colleagues who changed side to join Dr Machar. However, the last attack on Malakal, which caused the drowning of 200 people, came from armed youth mobilised among Dr Machar's supporters from greater Nasir in eastern Upper Nile. It defeats the logic of convention war for anyone to order armed civilians to attack convention army holed up in a fortified military garrison. Such a venture can result in heavy losses as it happened in the last attack on Malakal. Around Juba, there is a collection of soldiers who hail from Nuer community who deserted/escaped from Juba and other army garrisons within greater Equatoria. They are hiding in the bushes south-west of Juba. These are the group believed to have killed a senior army officer called Marach Akoon with his body guards on Juba-Yie Road. They occasionally lay roadblocks, kill passengers from specific tribe(s) and rob others of money and mobile phones. As anyone can discern, it is war all over. The peace talks in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa under auspices of IGAD have stalled many times because of the demand from Dr Machar's side that his 9 or so comrades arrested by the government in Juba should be released to join his negotiating team. Frankly speaking, the people under arrest may be innocent. According to Madam Rebecca Nyadeng, Dr John Garang's widow, they were picked from their houses, following Juba incident. The argument is that they could have not staged a coup and stayed in their houses. They could have hidden themselves or escaped with Dr Machar. In this respect, the ongoing investigation, if impartial, may set them free. South Sudanese should not be kept ransoms to their release that can be normally done through legal processes. Again, there is nothing the detainees can say in peace talks, which cannot be said by Dr. Machar himself or Governor Taban Deng, the head of delegation. Taban was unconstitutionally removed from governorship of Unity state by President Kiir. President Kiir is partly reaping what he has sown. If this war erupted as a result of attempted coup; accidental fight among the members of presidential guards unit; the outrage caused by target killing in Juba; or power struggle between Kiir and his former deputy then it should stop with immediate effect. For those who took law into their own hands because of the spirit of revenge, time has lapsed. One month killing has devastating the country. Justice and healing processes should be given a chance. The crimes already committed against the people of South Sudan are heinous enough to take some of the belligerents to the International Court of Justice (ICC) in The Hague. It will be therefore futile for the leaders involved in this conflict to fight for power when the law will get it in their neck sooner than later. Further, control of the country by forces by either side will not yield fruits because the other side will always fight back, creating a vicious circle of civil strife. The principal option for people of South Sudan, with the help of international community, is to put in place a neutral care-taking government that can reunite the citizens, heal the wounds and impartially conduct the coming elections. The current leaders are too entangled (in the current crisis) to be disentangled. God save people South Sudan from the senseless war and mediocre leadership!!!

"The article discusses the United Nations conference held in Istanbul in May, which focused on the world's 48 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and aimed to encourage investors to view these countries as potential business opportunities rather than burdens. The conference emphasized the importance of trade, investment and productive capacities, as well as economic diversification to reduce Africa's LDCs dependence on extractive sectors. While renewed pledges for aid commitments were made, the focus was largely on encouraging foreign investment and improving market access. African LDCs, in particular, were urged to follow models of sound economic policies and invest in productive sectors to further strengthen improvements.","Istanbul - Two foreign shoe sellers were once sent to Africa in search of new customers. At the sight of locals marching barefoot, the first retreated in despair. The second rejoiced at the untapped market. He ordered thousands of shoes, sold them to locals and became a wealthy man, or so the tale goes. There is an appealing parallel that Cheikh Sidi Diarra, the UN special adviser on Africa and high representative for least developed countries (LDCs) is willing to draw between this story and the reality of the world's 48 LDCs (33 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa): ""Despite the many ills these countries endure, the world needs to start looking at them more as lands of opportunities rather than a burden,"" he says. Urging investors to consider nations associated with endemic poverty, disease and instability as a potential business magnet is a bold invitation. Yet the call is in line with the general tone of an international gathering that Mr. Diarra led in May in Istanbul, Turkey. Since 1981 the once-a-decade UN conference has focused on the world's most vulnerable countries (as defined by low per-capita incomes, low standards of living and high vulnerability to economic shocks). Its aim has been to mobilize support, including by encouraging developed nations to disburse more aid to LDCs. In the past, much time has been devoted to this issue. This time, however, talk about aid was not central. That was in part a result of the budget constraints imposed on rich countries by a frustratingly slow economic recovery. A growing realization that aid alone cannot solve the fundamental problems LDCs face added to what some see as a welcome shift away from the usual debates. Ultimately, the Istanbul Programme of Action renewed aid commitments made at the previous conference in Brussels, Belgium, 10 years ago. Donors pledged to devote between 0.15 and 0.2 per cent of their gross national incomes (GNIs) to aid to LDCs. Civil society groups in Istanbul criticized that as too little. ""Having caused massive costs in the LDCs through financial and food speculation, unjust trade rules, illegitimate loans with onerous conditionality and ecological damage, including climate change, the developed countries have not even committed to provide more aid to LDCs,"" they said. This is a charge that Mr. Diarra disputed. Although not new, this promise of aid remains an important one, he argued, adding that if fulfilled, it would likely raise the amount of aid actually going to LDCs from its current annual level of $38 billion. The emphasis in Istanbul was on trade, investment and productive capacities. Months before the meeting, trade issues were at the centre of some of the most heated debates among negotiators. African LDCs called for the adoption of a long-debated scheme that would allow all their exports to enter developed-country markets without any duties or quotas. Such preferential treatment was considered a step too far by most developed countries, however, even though LDCs' share of world trade currently stands at only 1 per cent. The charms of the crossroads city of Istanbul did not change any minds. Instead, there was renewal of yet another decade-old commitment: tariff-free access to developed nations' markets for 97 per cent of LDCs' exports. Unfortunately for African LDCs, this arrangement provides little benefit, as the 3 per cent of exports excluded from tariff-free treatment covers some of the countries' most important export products, including agricultural commodities such as sugar, rice, meat and dairy products. African LDCs' quest for more foreign investment received a stronger boost. Measures designed to encourage developed countries' corporations to invest in LDCs were adopted, with governments expected to encourage their companies to invest in LDCs by providing fiscal incentives and special lines of credit. In recent years the 33 LDCs from Africa have benefited most from the growth in foreign direct investment (FDI) to LDCs, which rose from $4.1 billion to $32.4 billion between 2001 and 2008. African LDCs accounted for almost half of that total. Yet not only did FDI's eight-year growth come to a brief halt following the global recession, it also appears that FDI is mostly oriented toward just a few sectors, such as oil and minerals. As a result, few jobs have been created and strong growth in oil-rich countries such as Angola and Equatorial Guinea has yet to translate into meaningful change in people's lives. Such trends must change if foreign investment is to help reduce poverty, which affects over half the population in the continent's LDCs. In order for it to do so, the Istanbul Programme of Action calls for economic diversification to reduce African LDCs' dependence on the extractive sector. One major point of agreement among delegates in Istanbul was the need to invest in productive sectors, including agriculture, industry and infrastructure. The Programme of Action refers to these as ""development multipliers,"" as improvement in each area will benefit others. In an era of rising food prices, the call for further investment in agriculture is of particular interest to Africa, as the continent spends around $33 billion every year on food imports. As the rest of the world hears calls to look at the continent in a more positive way, are the continent's LDCs ready to seize the opportunity? ""There is no doubt many African LDCs are performing better. Sound economic policies are leading to strong improvements in various areas,"" asserted Mr. Diarra. Based on their strengths and needs, more African LDCs should follow suit, he urges. If they do, the legendary foreign shoe sellers arriving in Africa may be left only with the impression that they came in far too late.

The article also highlights KCB's commitment to supporting South Sudanese towards achieving economic independence.","Juba — The Kenyan Commercial Bank (KCB) on Wednesday unveiled a SSP 200,000 ($40,000) cheque in support of the dilapidated Juba military hospital, as part of the institution's corporate social responsibility to the community. The event, held at the military hospital premises in Juba, the South Sudan capital, kicked off with a tour of the visibly under-funded health facility, which was run jointly by Khartoum and Juba during the interim period of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement until South Sudan seceded in July last year. While speaking at the occasion, John Kimanthi, KCB Sudan managing director lauded the relationship between East Africa's largest commercial bank and South Sudan, which he said commenced before signing of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. The CPA ended over two decades of a bloody civil war fought between southern rebels and Sudanese government and gave South Sudan greater autonomy for a six-year period, followed by the right to independence through a referendum, which took place last year. Kimanthi said that his bank began full operations in South Sudan in May 2006, when Southern Sudan was a semi-autonomous region of Sudan, after obtaining official license from the Central Bank in Khartoum. The fist two branches were in Juba and Rumbek, the provincial capital of Lakes State. Currently, KCB has 19 branches spread all over the 10 states of the world's newest nation, employing over nearly 330 staff, and 80% of which are South Sudanese nationals. ""It has not been an easy walk,"" Kimanthi told Sudan Tribune, while applauding the ""strong commitment and persistence"" from KCB staff at all levels.

In the education sector, for instance, KCB has supported South Sudanese students through scholarships, constructed schools and provided school facilities, including reading materials. ""As a bank, we strongly believe that an educated society is an empowered society,"" she said amidst applause. On the environment, KCB has reportedly planted 31,000 trees throughout South Sudan, while the donation to the hospital is meant to support the health ministry in its efforts to improve service delivery in the country. Peter Muthoka, the outgoing KCB board chairman emphasised the importance of strong partnership with countries where the bank currently operates. To-date, he said KCB boasts of 223 branches spread throughout Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and South Sudan. He pledged the banks continued commitment towards supporting South Sudanese, saying the country will make an immense contribution to the East African Community (EAC) once it becomes a member. ""KCB is here to stay with the people of South Sudan,"" noted Muthoka, adding KCB is committed to helping South Sudan, where it reportedly controls 42% of the banking industry, achieve its economic independence.

""We hope that the signing of an agreement in Addis will bring fighting to a stop and allow WFP and other humanitarian agencies to provide urgently needed relief to the people affected by this conflict,"" said WFP Country Director Chris Nikoi. ""But it is important to note that humanitarian needs will continue, long after the fighting stops."" So far, WFP has assisted some 178,000 people displaced as a result of the South Sudan crisis, which erupted in mid-December. WFP and its partners have distributed food in many locations, including Juba, Bentiu, Bor, Malakal, Leer, Mingkaman, Yirol East, Yirol West, Mabior, and Aweng. Distributions are planned for the town of Nimule, near the Ugandan border, in the coming week. WFP remains concerned that the conflict has done so much damage that many people will continue to need food assistance for months - or longer - as they attempt to rebuild their lives. Many homes, food markets and small businesses have been destroyed, and many people have lost their annual harvest, leaving them with nothing at a time of year when they struggle to feed their families. WFP has launched a US$57.8 million emergency operation to respond to urgent food needs of displaced and conflicted-affected people in South Sudan. Donor contributions are urgently required for this operation and to provide food for the tens of thousands of people who have fled across South Sudan's borders into the neighbouring countries of Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan. Humanitarian access and looting of food stocks remain a major concern. WFP's warehouses in Malakal have been almost entirely emptied by repeated incidents of looting. This is greatly complicating efforts to assist people affected by the conflict in Malakal, the people seeking shelter in the UNMISS Protection of Civilians (PoC) site in the town and in other parts of Upper Nile State. WFP is urgently working to move more food into Malakal, possibly through airlifts, in order to support the tens of thousands of people displaced by fighting. While distributions to more than 200,000 people in pre-existing refugee camps in Upper Nile and Unity States continue, the fighting has also hampered delivery of food urgently needed to replenish stocks that will enable this support to continue through the year.

The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry called for increased investment to improve food security and highlighted the impact of drought on crops. The article also mentions rising food prices in the region and the possibility of famine in other countries including Burundi, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Congo DRC, Madagascar, and Mozambique. The government encourages a participatory approach to farming to improve the sector and assist in poverty reduction.","Juba — The government of new Republic of South Sudan on Thursday called on development partners to provide considerable financial assistance in order for new state to increase food production. The government also called on farmers to scale up food production to offset the looming threats of hunger and to focus on using sustainable food production to also benefit from local markets. Anne Itto the caretaker minister of agriculture and forestry told the press on Thursday that ways must be found to increase yields with a combination of knowledge, technology and investment. ""We have whatever it takes to scale up production and that should be our aim because drought is a reality for us and even a number of countries across the region,"" she said. The drought which has hit several countries in East Africa, including Somalia is said to be the worst in 60 years. Itto hopes that increased investment will improve food security by eliminating the current shortages that have engulfed the new country. In her address, the Minister mentioned that South Sudan has unreliable rainfall, which hampers agricultural planning. ""Some parts of our country are experiencing unreliable rains. Some places like Northern Bahr el Ghazal state have gone for more than three weeks without rain"". ""This has significant effect on crops which have already been planted"", said Ito claiming that Burundi, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Congo DRC, Madagascar and Mozambique are all facing the possibility of famine. She said prices for basic goods have gone up because most of the areas depend on imported food. ""We are experiencing [an] upsurge in food prices. I am told maize price in Nairobi has gone up from 215 USD per ton (323/- per kilo) in January to 465 USD per ton (744/-per kilo) in June 2011, reflecting price increase of 130 per cent. These prices are quadrupled in South Sudan because of transport cost"", she said. The senior member of the South Sudan's ruling party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) explained that the policy of her ministry encourages participatory approach of all groups and associations of farmers, livestock keepers, suppliers, processors, transporters, researchers, in order to push for improved economical and organisational environment for the sector. She believes that a dialogue between stakeholders and a strengthening of agricultural associations can assist the sector in becoming commercialised and highly productive, leading to poverty reduction and an improved standard of living for the agricultural community, which make up the majority in South Sudan.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,agriculture,0,0

"The article discusses the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) related to health, including child health, maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, and environmental sustainability, in South Sudan. However, due to high corruption rates, natural disasters, army and military aid priority, extreme poverty, inadequate funding, inadequate personnel, inefficient recruitment processes, poor development, lack of middle income status, and high rates of ignorance, the country is struggling to achieve its MDG targets. Possible solutions include child spacing, positive parenting, safe motherhood, immunization, faithfulness among married couples, the distribution of quality condoms, awareness of environmental conservation policies, standardizing hydroelectricity power to reduce tree cutting, and improving farming methods.","Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) are eight international development goals that all 192 which recently became 193 after South Sudan got Independence on 9th July 2011 and United Nations member States and at least 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve by the year 2015. They include: 1-End poverty & hunger eradication. 2- Universal Education. 3- Gender Equality. 4- Child health. 5- Maternal Health. 6- Combat HIV/AIDS. 7- Environmental sustainability. 8-Global Partnership. The aim of Millennium Development Goals is to encourage development by improving social and economic conditions in the world's poorest countries. They derive from earlier international development targets and were officially established at the Millennium Summit in 2000, where all world leaders present adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration from which the eight goals were promoted. However, since Sudan is a signatory to the MDGS which were initiated by United Nations in 2000, the Health Sector in South Sudan is running under 10 years health policy developed in 1999. The policy and its Health Sector strategy Plan (HSSP) running from 2000-2005 and (HSSP2) should be run from 2005-2009 and finally from 2010-2015. All these were attempts to attainment of good health by all people in South Sudan in order to promote a healthy and productive life. This recognizes that health is needed for production, contributing to the PEAP Programme , are usually supported by MDGS programme monitors by World Bank.Consequently, the following are the Millennium development goals related to the health including Child Health, Maternal Health, Combat HIV/ AIDS and Sustainability. All these mentioned above looks at the preventative of human lives from the adolescence age to the adult. To make matters worse most of the death cases are rampant to children under five (5) years. The main target was to protect the children under five years as well as the pregnant mothers especially during pregnancy and after the child birth. These programmes have four related health of Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) are less attained in South Sudan Health Sector due to the following reasons or factors as explained below:-High rate of corruption in the country has resulted to less attainment of these four Millennium development Goals MDGS related to health like Child health, Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS and Environmental sustainability. Handling Millennium Development Goals fund has been arduous and ridiculous because some government officials tend to embezzle as well as misappropriate or misuse health sector funds. For example former Minister of Health in the year 2003-2004, made this money meant to combat HIV/AIDS in all parts of the country to go to other projects thus this eventually led to less attainment of MDGS in South Sudan. Natural disaster relief in most places of the country has hindered the progress of this MDGS programme. This natural disaster has been rampant in the Greater Bahr el Ghazal region, Upper Nile region and Equatoria region which claims much of money that could be used to treat people, construction of health centres, clinics and Primary Health Care (PHC) and these places could handle the cases of Child Health, Maternal Health, Combat HIV/AIDS and Environmental Sustainability. This natural disaster led to massive relief that takes much of money to help people being affected by floods, drought, famine and; disease outbreak like measles, Ebola, cholera, and many places dangerous has culminated to the attainment of MDGS related to health in South Sudan.Large army as well as military aid has been the cornerstone to the attainment of MDGS related health because much of government budget are allocated for army as first priority in the country due to prevailing insurgency or rebel activities in Upper Nile state, Jonglei State and Abyei which later made the government to introduce the Iron Fist operation programme which was only designed to wipe out Lord Resistance Army (LRA) in South Sudan borders with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Central Africa Republic (CAR), the activities of peace keeping in Abyei leaving the programme of health like Combat HIV/AIDS, safe mother project with little , unfunded or inadequate that could not sustain its existence effectively and efficiently. Lack of middle income status from the people due to extreme poverty in the country has led to the less attainment of health Millennium Development Goals because people are unable to afford medical services on their own, and this makes it difficult for the government to conserve the environment effectively, besides the construction of water treatment plant and waste management also become inevitable as a result of frequent outbreak of cholera plus other water borne diseases. The mismatch between aspirations of the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) and available resources is the major problem facing the health sector. This has been a major arena that confronted government projects due to the disproportions of the available resources with the proposed project's budget. For instance, the construction of water system plan, water treatment plant HIV/AIDS campaign project that aims at the catering for the victims and supporting them at all levels become huge budget that cannot be afforded because of huge expenditures.Inadequate funding and shortage of personnel owing to inadequate number of workers that can deliver standard service to the patients in the hospitals this has resulted into what ""I can call sit and wait hospitals"" without proper medical services given to the people. For example, the maternal and child health need much attention to be paid so that the lives of mothers and children could be safe, but due to the inadequate funds and personnel or medical experts that can educate people on the following ways such as, child spacing, positive parenting, safe motherhood and antenatal care are lacking to render such crucial services to the people. However, it has led to the less attainment of MDGS related to health sector as elaborated above.There is also inefficient recruitment processes and poor development have persisted for many years as well as inadequate network of a fully functional and health infrastructure that can morally boost the progress and jeopardize the health performance especially on the side of maternal and child healthcare most of the doctors might be specializing in different fields that could not handle the processes of child birth complications and pregnancy.There is also inadequate of stock of drugs and supplies for common occurrence in most of hospital and primary health cares in the country which eventually makes it difficult for South Sudan to achieve her four health MDGS since there is very slow establishment of village health teams. For example, the ARVS drugs and protection of quality condoms that could reduce the effect of virus, those drugs are meant for HIV/AIDS patients become difficult to be accessed at all levels more especially in the rural areas. High rate of ignorance amongst the people has also led to the less attainment of MDGS related to health like Child health, Maternal health, Combat HIV/AIDS and Environmental Sustainability. In this way, most people in rural and urban centres tend to ignore the use of ARVS and condoms due to influence of traditions, attitudes, beliefs and personality traits. This makes it difficult for government to plan according to the demand and usage.The spontaneous increase in population which is around 8.2 million according to recent census as well as rampant influx of foreigners especially from neighbouring countries has made it inevitable for the government of South Sudan to implement land conservation policy and environmental management as well as supply of essential drugs. This population increase has also led to poor waste disposal hence making it difficult to implement health related MDGS.Government policies and laws that regulate or support health actions and practices for disease prevention, early detection, control and management has been very poor hence leaving societies unaware of the repercussions of that diseases like HIV/AIDS, child health and maternal health and environmental management or sustainability become inevitable to be achieved in South Sudan.I think the following are the possible and practical strategies that policy makers must address such that the attainment of this Millennium Development Goals related to health. These include:- Child HealthThe possible practical for this MDG is that the policy of child spacing refers to the use of contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy and to increase the time between the children being produced should be introduced such that parents will have time to plan on how to bring up each child under good care in term of feeding and treatment. By doing this, it will help the government to plan a reasonable budget.There should be a fixed number of children to be produced by each family so that the issue of population increase is solved amicably. Provisions of social benefits should also be added whereby the person who has two children must have some benefits than those who produce more than two children this would encourage spacing plan.Government should make positive parenting as a policy where parents emphasis their role in their children's physical, emotional, social and spiritual development such that child grows in healthy life. Introduction of Primary health Care with integrated referral systems in a way that gives priority to those most in need and addresses health inequalities, maximizes community and individual self-reliance, participation and control and even involvement of collaboration and partnership with other sectors will help government to address in order to attain them. The immunization policy should be adored for and immunization uses the body's national defense mechanism, this response is to build resistance to specific infections of the nine diseases which can be prevented by routine immunization and they include; diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis (polio), measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenza type B and Hepatitis B. This immunization must be done through vaccination that will protect a person physically, socially, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Maternal Health Refers to the strategy used to improve health of mothers and children particularly around child birth and thereafter.Safe motherhood project should be advanced in all places such that it caters for pregnant women in the district and this will reduce on the rampant of child birth and during pregnancy. The Family planning strategy must be encouraged at all stages so that child spacing can be implemented; hence this can result to better health conditions. This needs government to adopt it as a policy and ask all citizens to comply with that as soon as possible.The child spacing must be implemented as this will help mothers to cater for their few children to be healthy than having many with risks. Combat HIV/AIDSThe practical strategy that policy makers must implement is the abstinence by avoiding random sexual activities which are measured by delaying first sex or engagement in the premarital sex and this will help reduce on the random or unwanted pregnancies hence also reduce abortions.Another way should be faithfulness among the married couples. I think this can be another way of controlling infectious disease like HIV/AIDS plus others. Therefore, the policy makers must impose this proper if people are found doing the opposite of it and they must be fined to pay something for committing adultery.Government should increase supply of quality types of condoms and distribute them to all the districts equally besides this they must sensitize people on how to use condom and its importance. This will stop them from taking condom for granted.Over supportive counseling to the patience of AIDS and also have an open door admission policy at all time by welcoming the victims of AIDS infections.Environmental SustainabilityGovernment must create awareness team to educate people on the impact of environmental conservation policy and this will help to control unnecessary reclamation of wetland and swamp areas in the country. Government should standardize hydroelectricity power as this will reduce the level of trees cutting for charcoal for cooking. It is because of lack of enough power energy that forces people to get rid of forest.Government must enforce and take affirmative action against those who encroach on the forest as a result of deforestation and environmental degradation. By doing this some projects must be created to help safeguard environment with clear laws that punish and grant one to do so.Improving on farming method by standardizing the tools used than using the traditional methods of farming that is mainly using rudimentary tools like pangas, hoes plus others which should be improved by supporting farmers at all levels.In conclusion, it is imperative to note that most of MDGS related to health like Child health, Maternal health, Combat HIV/AIDS and Environmental Sustainability has been lessened to attain due to the reasons mentioned above with suggested possible strategies that I think government should adopt to implement the co-existence of MDGS to their targets for the year 2015.",NEGATIVE,,demographics,0,-1
