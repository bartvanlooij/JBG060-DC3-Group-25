"The article discusses a massive humanitarian operation launched by the United Nations to help 50,000 people affected by inter-ethnic conflict in South Sudan's Jonglei state. The conflict is between the Lou Nuer and Murle communities, with brutal massacres resulting in the deaths of thousands of people, mostly women and children. The UN is sending aid agencies to assess the needs of those affected and provide food, water, and shelter. The location of the event includes Pibor Likuangole, Boma, Walgak, and other areas in Jonglei state.","The United Nations on Friday said it is launching a massive humanitarian operation to help an estimated 50,000 people hit by inter-ethnic conflict in South Sudan's Jonglei state. ""The United Nations is launching a massive humanitarian emergency,"" said the media spokeswoman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Elisabeth Byrs on Friday. The programme is aimed at helping thousands of people to return home after clashes between the Lou Nuer and Murle communities, OCHA said. During the last 72 hours, UN experts have assessed the situation in Pibor Likuangole, Boma and Walgak. ""The needs are great, of course,"" Byrs said. ""It is currently estimated that 50,000 people are affected by violence in the region"" of South Sudan. ""Thousands of people now need food, water and shelter. Aid agencies are assessing their needs,"" Byers added. ""The situation in humanitarian terms is grim,"" said UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande via video link. A top local Sudanese official said more than 3,000 people were killed in brutal massacres last week. ""There have been mass killings, a massacre,"" said Joshua Konyi, commissioner for Pibor county in Jonglei state. ""We have been out counting the bodies, and we calculate so far that 2,182 women and children were killed and 959 men died."" United Nations and South Sudanese army officials have yet to confirm the death tolls and the claims from the remote region could not be independently verified. If confirmed, the killing of 3,141 people would be the worst outbreak of ethnic violence ever seen in southern Sudan, which became a separate nation after splitting from Khartoum in July. A column of some 6,000 rampaging armed youths from the Lou Nuer tribe last week marched on the remote town of Pibor, home to the rival Murle people, whom they blame for abductions and cattle raiding and have vowed to exterminate. The Lou Nuer attacked Pibor at the weekend, torching huts and looting a hospital, and only withdrew after government troops moved in. More than 1,000 children are missing, feared abducted, while tens of thousands of cows were stolen, added Konyi, who is himself an ethnic Murle.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,1,1
"The article discusses the fighting between government and rebel forces in South Sudan's Unity State, particularly in the towns of Mayom and Bentiu. The conflict has resulted in the displacement of at least 274,000 people, with few civilians able to escape and receive assistance. MSF's hospital in Agok has only received military personnel, prompting concerns that civilians are not receiving necessary medical attention. There are also reports of traumatised and tired Internally Displaced People (IDP) seeking aid in Turalei and Abyei, with many others potentially caught in further fighting.","In the last few weeks, 81 wounded soldiers have escaped fighting over Mayom in South Sudan's oil-rich Unity State to receive surgery in Agok hospital - but not one civilian. The town of Mayom, 80 km southeast of the hospital, has been devastated by fighting between government and rebel forces in recent days. ""We've been receiving gunshot victims here, but they are all military,"" David Nash, head of mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in South Sudan, said in a telephone interview from Agok. ""We have not received any civilians and that worries me ... If they are not getting out, then I am afraid they are not receiving assistance."" MAIN BATTLEFRONTS Three weeks of fighting, often along ethnic faultlines, has pitted President Salva Kiir's SPLA government forces against rebels loyal to former vice president Riek Machar and brought South Sudan, the world's youngest state, close to civil war. At least 1,000 have been killed and 274,000 displaced since the conflict broke out on Dec. 15. Unity State is one of the main battlefronts because of its valuable oil fields. Its strategically-important towns of Mayom and Bentiu were taken by rebels, who defected from the national army, last month. This week, there has been fierce fighting as the government seeks to regain control of them. Government ambulances carried the wounded soldiers from Mayom to MSF's hospital in Agok, Nash said. ""This is a hospital and MSF doesn't make any distinctions between anyone. Once they walk in here, if they are hurt, then they are called a patient,"" he said. Civilians are not so fortunate. There are 375,000 people living in the two counties surrounding Mayom and Bentiu, according to the U.N. South Sudan humanitarian coordinator, Toby Lanzer, and ""in both many are on the move"". TRAUMATISED AND TIRED Few are reaching safety. To the west, there are 3,000 Internally Displaced People (IDP) in Turalei, Warrap State, and to the north, another 1,500 are in Abyei, Nash said, after visiting the two sites. They are receiving aid from agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and GOAL. ""They were looking traumatised and very tired. It's mainly women and children; some older men but not the young ones... They looked very worried,"" he said, after visiting Turalei, 110 km west of Mayom, on Wednesday. ""This is a very small number considering the amount of fighting that seems to have gone on."" He fears other people many have headed eastwards into yet more fighting. WORSE BY THE DAY Government forces are poised to retake Bentiu, 90 km east of Mayom. The town has emptied, with thousands walking southwards to find safety. Some 8,000 people are sheltering in the U.N. military base in Bentiu, which it has tried to secure by building trenches, Lanzer said on Twitter. ""The situation remains extremely fluid with movements of people and new IDPs reported almost daily, and changing dynamics of whether a road or area is safe to travel or not,"" Heather Blackwell, country director for the Danish Refugee Council, which is providing assistance in the U.N. base in Bentiu, said in an email. It is a situation replicated in other parts of the country, with IDPs scattering to dozens of remote locations. The United Nations estimates that 274,000 people have been displaced since the conflict began, with almost 60,000 hosted in U.N. bases and 42,800 crossing borders as refugees. ""Conditions for the South Sudanese fleeing hostilities in their country are getting worse by the day,"" Valerie Amos said in a statement. The latest death toll estimates vary. The International Crisis Group told the New York Times the number of dead was close to 10,000, while the U.N.'s peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous says it is ""very substantially in excess of the figure of 1,000"".",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,hunger,0,0
"The article discusses the efforts of South Sudan Red Cross volunteers in repairing and rehabilitating water sites in Aweil Centre County and constructing new water sites in several areas, providing access to clean water for approximately 58,000 people. The volunteers also promote hygiene practices, construct a vegetable garden, and emphasize the need for water management committees to prevent breakdowns and contamination of water sources.","Sitting in the dust on the road, long metal pipes lay, ready to be installed. Under the tropical sun of Northern Bahr El Gazhal, a team of South Sudan Red Cross volunteers is sweating in the heat, lively chatting while repairing a broken platform of a water site in Aweil Centre County. With the support of local hand pump mechanics, the volunteers have repaired 30 water sites over the last few months, to protect water sources from spillage and possible contamination. Each of these sites caters to approximately 500 users, providing access to clean water to more than 15,000 people. Dominic Garang Aleu is a teacher who joined the South Sudan Red Cross as a volunteer in 2013. He fled from his village when he was a child during the civil war in Sudan, and came into contact with the Red Cross for the first time as a refugee in Kenya. He is now leading the water facilities rehabilitation team of the Aweil branch and knows all too well the challenges his people face. ""No one feels responsible for a water site, therefore every point must have a water management committee in place to prevent breakdown,"" says Dominic. He highlights the need to combine the maintenance work of the committee with trainings to emphasize the importance of hygiene. ""As a result,"" he adds, ""people started to clean up around the water sites, fenced their water points, and even collected money to cater to borehole repairs."" Seven new sites equipped with hand pumps were constructed in several areas of Aweil Centre County as there was no existing supply of clean water. One of the new sites lies between the villages of Nyikualal, Mayomdit and Amanjam. ""People living around here used to go to the Chel river in the west and it would take them three hours to get water,"" explains Paskuala Duma, who lives nearby. ""Now it takes a maximum of 30 minutes, and in the rainy season, people no longer have to fetch water from the puddles and little ponds."" Paskuala says he is aware of the dangers of contaminated water so he used to boiling his drinking water. He admits, however, that this is usually a lengthy process and not many people treat their water despite knowing the dangers. ""Last year during the cholera outbreak, we had to go out and demonstrate water purification techniques to households to control the outbreak,"" says David Mitu, water and sanitation coordinator, South Sudan Red Cross. ""Together with our partners, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, we also carried out interventions to bring the 'number one medicine' - safe water - to people affected by the outbreak."" Volunteers visit communities every week, sensitizing people on the importance of hygiene, and working with them to improve their hygiene practices. John Mou, Aweil branch hygiene promotion supervisor, highlights that the availability of clean water to the people of Aweil means so much more. It contributes to improved hygiene practices, and means less time is spent collecting water. The volunteers have even constructed a vegetable garden irrigated through a special water yard running on solar power which has helped in boosting their food security. The South Sudan Red Cross is combining access to safe water with improved hygiene practices, a crucial combination in ensuring the right balance between action on sanitation and water. The activities in Northern Bahr El Gazhal are part of a long term project supported by the Austrian Red Cross, aimed at building the capacity of staff and volunteers in the water and sanitation sector. In total, the South Sudan Red Cross has, to date, provided clean water for approximately 58,000 people through this project.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,1,1
"The article discusses the influx of South Sudanese refugees into Uganda and the strain it is putting on resources and land. Uganda plans to re-open former refugee camps but is facing resistance from community members. The UN Refugee Agency urges communities to give up land to settle the refugees. Resources are further stretched by the arrival of refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo. Fighting between government and rebels in South Sudan is ongoing, and negotiations are being prepared in Addis Ababa.","Kampala — Thousands of South Sudanese fleeing violence have crossed into neighbouring Uganda, where officials say resources and land to meet their needs are in short supply. ""We had not expected this. We are struggling to handle the situation. The influx entails resources. These people need shelter, food, water, basic necessities and treatment. Some of them have injuries which need treatment,"" Musa Ecweru, Uganda's state minister for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, told IRIN. As of 1 January, some 7,580 South Sudanese had entered Uganda. Since fighting broke out on 15 December, around 194,000 people have been displaced within South Sudan. ""We are [planning on] re-opening our former refugee camps in Rhino and Dzaipi [in the northwestern districts of Arua and Adjumani] to put these people in. But the community members are resisting. We are negotiating with them to allow us to use their land to settle these people,' said Ecweru. Thousands of these camps' former residents returned home after South Sudan became an independent state in 2011. ""It would be good if the communities give up the land,"" said Mohamed Adar, Uganda Representative of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). ""We have good infrastructure built on those areas. At least we would start from there and build on."" Four reception centres have been opened for the refugees: in Keri in Koboko district, Rhino in Arua, Dzaipi in Adjumani at the Uganda-South Sudan border near Nimule, and one at Entebbe Airport. ""At the moment we have to transport these refugees to our government land in Kiryandongo which is too far and expensive,"" said Ecweru. Adar said resources had been further stretched by the arrival of refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the wake of clashes between DRC government army and the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group of Ugandan origin based in DRC. Some 2,000 DRC refugees fled into Uganda's western district of Bundibugy since 25 December 2013, when ADF attacked army positions at Kamango, near the DRC-Uganda border. Around 40 people were killed and 150,000 displaced by the fighting. ""The influx is coming at the beginning of the year. We are yet to receive resources for our 2014 operations. This is now the stage where we require substantial resources to gear up our operations to respond to the refugee influx,"" said Adar. ""It's a very fast- moving and dynamic situation. We are experiencing significant spike of refugees fleeing the fighting in South Sudan. We are now receiving about 1,000 people per day. We expect to surpass 10,000 by Friday [3 January],"" he said. Fighting was continuing in South Sudan on 2 January, notably in Jonglei State's main town of Bor and in Unity State. Meanwhile, delegations from the government and rebels were preparing for negotiations in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

"The article discusses the opening of a new refugee camp in Ajuong, located in Pariang county of South Sudan's Unity state, which is expected to hold about 20,000 refugees. The camp aims to manage further inflows of Sudanese refugees and alleviate the overcrowded conditions in the existing Yida settlement. The article notes that UNHCR is also planning to open other camps in Unity State which could eventually hold an estimated 110,000 refugees.","Juba — United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is set to open a new refugee camp in the coming weeks in South Sudan's Unity state. UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards announced this yesterday. Speaking in Geneva, Mr Edwards said the new refugee camp ""will help to manage further inflows of Sudanese refugees and to decongest the existing settlement in Yida"" where essential services are overstretched. ""Together with the South Sudanese government we have agreed to locate the new camp at Ajuong, a forested area of red sandy soil with good terrain, water resources, and plenty of space"", he said. Ajuong is located in the border county of Pariang and is expected to hold about 20,000 refugees. Mr Edwards noted that refugee leaders and UNHCR have been working jointly to assess the suitability of the new site. After a ""go and see visit"" organized for members of the refugee community, refugees determined that the site is suitable for them. The black cotton soil in the area could be used for agriculture by the refugee population. He also reported that the local communities in the area have also reacted positively to the proposal. UNHCR also said it is planning to open other camps in Unity State which could eventually hold an estimated 110,000 refugees. Yida, which holds 61,000 people, currently is the largest refugee location in South Sudan. However the Yida site presents major problems, in large part because it is totally cut off during the six months of the rainy season, posing serious hygiene and health risks. According to the UNHCR spokesperson, the World Food Programme last year alone had to fly in 2,500 metric tons of food at high cost while UNHCR airlifted thousands of tons of essential relief items such as buckets, plastic sheets, and medicines. ""We are hoping that many existing refugees in other camps will choose to relocate there. The new site will allow refugees to live in a safe environment where better conditions exist for self-reliance and livelihoods assistance"", he said.",NEGATIVE,,refugees,1,0
"The article discusses how tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees in Jamam camp, located in Upper Nile, South Sudan, are facing life-threatening water shortages and a growing threat of fatal disease. Oxfam has urged all agencies and local authorities to urgently prepare a new safe and secure site for 23,000 people, where long-term water sources can be found.","Refugees Face Life threatening water shortages and need urgent relocation as conflict spreads. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees face desperate, life-threatening water shortages and a growing threat of fatal disease in Jamam camp in South Sudan and must be urgently moved to a new site, international agency Oxfam said today. As conflict spreads along the border between Sudan and South Sudan, there are fears that more refugees could arrive in a camp that is already stretched beyond its limits and unable to cope with a further influx. Extensive work by Oxfam and other organizations has been unable to find enough safe and reliable sources of water to meet the growing needs. Heavy rains in the coming weeks will make delivering aid and relocating the refugees even more difficult, and will further exacerbate an escalating humanitarian crisis, Oxfam said. The rains will increase the threat of diseases such as malaria and cholera, and destroy the flimsy shelters under which new arrivals are sheltering. ""We are fast running out of time and options in the midst of a huge humanitarian crisis. We have drilled for water and carried out a geological survey, but there is simply not enough ground water available to sustain the growing number of people who need it. Women have to queue for hours in the burning sun just to collect a fraction of the water they need, and the situation is getting more desperate by the day. The only solution is for people to be moved urgently,"" said Pauline Ballaman, head of Oxfam's operations in Jamam. Since December, nearly 37,000 refugees have arrived in Jamam, fleeing the ongoing conflict in Sudan's Blue Nile state, and more continue to arrive. More than 100,000 people have been forced to flee Sudan because of the fighting in Blue Nile and the parallel conflict in Southern Kordofan, and hundreds of thousands more have been displaced within Sudan. Oxfam urged all agencies and local authorities to urgently prepare a new safe and secure site for 23,000 people, where long-term water sources can be found. This region of Upper Nile is one of the most remote and least developed parts of South Sudan and safe drinking water is extremely scarce. The existing boreholes can only provide the recommended amount of water for about 16,500 people, but there is already twice that number in Jamam camp, and families continue to arrive each day. Shortages are also increasing among the several thousand permanent residents of the area. Oxfam is concerned tensions over competition for water are growing between the refugee community and permanent residents. Ultimately, Oxfam said, the only sustainable solution to the crisis is for all parties to negotiate for long-term peace in Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan and the rest of the border region, so that refugees can return home.",NEGATIVE,,refugees,-1,-1

He was the 34th aid worker killed in South Sudan since conflict erupted there in December 2013, according to U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The world's youngest country descended into civil war when a row between President Salva Kiir and former government deputy Riek Machar escalated into fighting often running along ethnic fault lines between Kiir's Dinka and Machar's Nuer people. Kiir and Machar, facing international pressure and the threat of sanctions, signed a peace deal in August but have repeatedly accused each other of ceasefire violations. Deteriorating security in Juba is hampering aid workers efforts to assist South Sudan, the U.N. said.

"The article discusses the ongoing violence and crisis in South Sudan since December 2013, which has led concerned citizens from various fields to call for an expanded peace process that includes all South Sudanese voices, an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access, accountability for all parties, and a citizen-driven national dialogue to address fundamental issues of governance and civil rights that have been neglected since 2005.","Expressing our alarm and concern with the ongoing violence, continued killing, loss of innocent lives and destruction of property in South Sudan since 15 December 2013, Affirming our moral responsibility to take a stance and be a positive force for peace and justice, Offering our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones in the violence, Recognizing that what started as a political dispute within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) has now become a crisis engulfing the whole country, We, concerned citizens of South Sudan, drawn from civil society, churches, academia, think tanks and national NGOs, hereby agree to the following statement: The violence has brought into question the legitimacy of current institutions of governance in South Sudan and has undermined any claims that the parties to the conflict have to being the custodians of the people's interest. There is no military solution. The failure of key institutions, including the executive, legislature, judiciary and army, has contributed to the crisis. Since 2005, fundamental issues of governance and civil rights have been neglected. These include the national constitution, elections, freedom of expression, accountability, justice, reconciliation and security sector reform. We therefore resolve that: 1. The peace process should be expanded to include voices from all sectors of South Sudanese society and to address the fundamental governance issues that allowed the conflict to proliferate so quickly. 2. All parties must commit to an immediate ceasefire and guarantee humanitarian access. 3. All parties must abide by international humanitarian and human rights law. 4. All parties must ensure the safety of civilians in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps and areas under their control. 5. All parties must be held accountable for their actions and justice must be delivered for the victims and survivors of the violence. 6. A citizen-driven national dialogue should be initiated to address the critical challenges facing the South Sudanese people in their efforts to develop a democratic state and to promote reconciliation and healing. 7. The indefinite detention without charge of South Sudanese political figures is a violation of South Sudanese and international law. Political detainees must either be charged and provided with legal representation or released. 8. The current mediations being brokered by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and states involved in the mediations should remain neutral to all parties. 9. Foreign governments should refrain from providing military assistance to any of the parties involved in the conflict as this will only contribute to the suffering of our people and should not be allowed. In recognition of the above findings and resolutions, we the Citizens for Peace and Justice commit ourselves to extending and continuing the dialogue with our fellow South Sudanese in the pursuit of a peaceful and just resolution to the conflict in our country.

South Sudan has put its military on maximum alert and is coordinating with the African Union to control the situation to prevent it from spilling over into its borders.","Juba — South Sudan said Saturday it is closely monitoring the security situation in the neigbouring Central Africa Republic (CAR) following a military takeover last week, raising fears that the instability could spill over into its African neighbours. Rebels led by Michel Djotodia, a former civil servant, seized power last week in a coup against the then president Francois Bozize. Djotodia, who has installed himself as the new head of state, said on Friday that he would review deals over resources signed by the previous government and has promised to step down after elections are held in 2016. The CAR shares a border with Sudan's western Darfur region and the South Sudanese states of Western Equatoria and Western Bahr el Ghazal. South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan in July 2011, is yet to properly demarcate the majority of its borders with Sudan, as well as its other neighbours. Ongoing border disputes with Sudan have prevented the new nation from clearly defining its often porous and un-demarcated borders with countries like CAR that are currently riven with conflicts. ""We have been closely monitoring [the] current security situation there, especially at our borders. The situation could simply get out of control if it is not monitored properly and carefully. It may slip toward the spiral of a vicious cycle"", Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information, told reporters. The government spokesperson said his country has put the military on ""maximum"" alert, as well as coordinating with the African Union (AU) to control the situation. He also praised the ""adequate, collective reaction"" of the AU, which, in line with its code of conduct, does not automatically recognise all coups or attempted coups that become a cause of concern. ""This was why the [African] Union swiftly condemned the military takeover and demanded the immediate restoration of the legitimate, constitutional and democratic institutions.

MSF has been working in South Sudan since 1983 and currently runs 16 projects in nine of the country's ten states and has set up three additional emergency operations in Juba, Awerial and Malakal.","Juba — At least 150 wounded people have been treated by the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) after a new wave of violence hit the town of Malakal, in Upper Nile state, South Sudan, on February 18. MSF fears that the escalating levels of violence are threatening the security of the population even in the place where most of the displaced people are currently seeking refuge, the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) compound, which hosts over 21,000 people. Gunshot wounds Most of the 150 wounded have been treated by MSF together with International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) teams in Malakal. The patients were admitted to the medical facility of the UNMISS. They suffered gunshot wounds from the clashes in town as well as injuries as a result of inter-communal fighting in the camp. Many of the people in town were obliged to seek refuge in the overcrowded UNMISS compound due to the high insecurity in the area. Some of these displaced people reported to our teams cases of the killing and rape of patients and relatives in the only functional hospital in town. This facility, where MSF had been working until February 17, has also been looted. MSF fears that more violence will have devastating consequences on the population. High levels of violence The high levels of violence have disrupted the humanitarian activities launched in Malakal. Also, in the past two days, more than 55 gunshot wounded patients from fighting in Malakal have been brought for treatment to MSF's facility in Nasir, Upper Nile state, with many more expected to arrive in the coming days. ""The high levels of violence have disrupted the humanitarian activities launched in Malakal to respond to the crisis,"" says Llanos Ortiz, MSF deputy emergency desk manager. ""The reigning insecurity is having a direct impact on the lives of the South Sudanese people and is also an obstacle for them to receive impartial medical humanitarian assistance."" Since the onset of the crisis last December, fighting throughout the country is having serious consequences for the population, stricken not only by violence but also by a pre-existing alarming humanitarian situation. ""There are episodes of violence in several areas of the country but South Sudan also suffers peaks of diseases such as measles and malaria. We are worried about the upcoming rainy season and the risk of outbreaks in a context where medical services have been widely disrupted,"" warns Ortiz. ""This paints a grim picture for a vulnerable population with a scarcity of resources."" MSF has been working in the region that today constitutes the Republic of South Sudan since 1983, and currently runs 16 projects in nine of the country's ten states - Agok, Aweil, Bentiu, Gogrial, Gumuruk, Leer, Maban, Malakal, Nasir, Yambio, Lankien, Yuai and Yida and has set up three additional emergency operations in Juba, Awerial and Malakal. MSF responds to emergencies, including large-scale displacement, refugee influxes, alarming nutrition situations and peaks of disease such as measles, malaria, acute watery diarrhoea and kala azar, in addition to providing basic and specialist healthcare services. MSF currently has 228 international staff working in its projects alongside 2,917 South Sudanese staff.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,demographics,-1,-1
