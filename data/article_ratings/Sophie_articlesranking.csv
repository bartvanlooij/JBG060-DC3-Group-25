"The article discusses a joint campaign by the South Sudan National and State Ministry of Health, Sanitation and Environment, UNICEF, and WFP to address the nutrition crisis that is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in South Sudan. The campaign involves a mass-screening program in several locations, including Juba County, Warrap, and Northern Bahr-Ghazal. The program aims to assess, screen and refer malnourished children, and instruct mothers and caregivers on healthy nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation practices. The campaign will be implemented by trained local social mobilizers, with support from UNICEF and WFP. Other strategies to address the nutrition crisis include engaging more local partners and improving data collection and coordination to ensure that even the most difficult to reach people are served.","Juba â€” The South Sudan National and State Ministry of Health, Sanitation and Environment, UNICEF and WFP kicked off a new outreach and a mass-screening campaign today to address the nutrition crisis, which UNICEF says is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. The first phase of the campaign will see 254 trained social mobilizers from the Government of South Sudan's Social Mobilization Network go door to door in Juba County. They will assess, screen and refer children for malnutrition, and also instruct mothers and caregivers in healthy nutrition, hygiene and sanitation practices for their young ones. ""Social mobilization has been essential in numerous health interventions such as polio eradication and cholera response,"" said Dr. Emmanuel Ija Bay, Minister of Health, Sanitation and Environment, Central Equatoria State. ""We are proud to deploy them to take on the issue of malnutrition, which traps children into a lifelong cycle of poor nutrition, illness, poverty and inequity."" The campaign is slated to expand in the coming weeks, with more than 600 social mobilizers reaching over 600,000 children in the high-burden, non-conflict affected states of Warrap and Northern Bahr-Ghazal, in addition to Juba. ""It is very important to find children who are sick and get them into care,"" said Vilma Tyler, chief of nutrition for UNICEF South Sudan. ""But helping mothers understand good feeding, hygiene and sanitation practices is essential to help families stay healthy over the long term."" Through the mass screening campaign in Juba County, over 116,000 children aged 6 months to 5 years will be screened and it is estimated that 6,500 children will be treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition in UNICEF-supported Oral Therapeutic Feeding Programmes (OTFP). The World Food Programme will be treating an estimated 16,700 children identified as suffering from Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) in Juba County and admitting them to Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programmes. ""Juba City is a metropolitan city where we find different nationalities and people from all the ten states of South Sudan,"" said Christopher Safarino Wani, Mayor of Juba City. ""During this mass screening campaign, I urge you all to make sure you reach out to all these people even in hard to reach locations."" In addition to the community mobilization, UNICEF will work with the County Health Departments to train staff in the Primary Healthcare Centres and Units in the management of all referral patients. This training will provide the foundations of South Sudan's long term and sustainable investment in health and nutrition care for the community. Nationwide, estimates predict that 235,000 children will suffer from Severe Acute Malnutrition by the end of the year. In response, UNICEF, WFP and the government have put into place multiple strategies, in addition to the community-based approach. These include engaging more local partners and improving their ability to treat malnutrition, prepositioning supplies, strengthening the supply pipeline and improving data collection and coordination to ensure that even the most difficult to reach people are served. Rapid Response Missions also play a critical role in delivering to the most vulnerable people. WFP and UNICEF, through airdrops and airlifts, deliver lifesaving nutrition supplies, health and sanitation services to people living in the most neglected areas. These joint missions have reached nearly 560,000 people and screened over 70,000 children under the age of five for malnutrition. More than 2,600 children under the age of five have been given treatment for Severe Acute Malnutrition, and mothers and caregivers given important information on healthy feeding for infants and children. UNICEF is prepositioning nutrition supplies to reach 100,000 more children during the dry season, when it expected that the nutrition crisis will deepen again. The nutrition scale up has received financing from several donors, including the European Commission - Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO).",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,1,1
"The article discusses the lack of communication from the ministries of agriculture in the Republic of South Sudan about their cultivation plans for the upcoming agricultural season, which is only a few weeks away. The author emphasizes the importance of planning ahead, investing in agriculture, and implementing policies to overcome food security problems. The focus is on encouraging local food production to reduce dependency on neighboring countries and to satisfy immediate requirements in the local areas before distributing crops to larger commercial centers.","This is January and soon it will end and we are not hearing in the press any programmes from the ministries of agriculture at national and state levels about their cultivation plans for the next agricultural season which is at the door. Early rains in most parts of Republic of South Sudan usually come in March which is less than two months away. It is with rains that cultivation in this new nation is closely related because our new ministry of electricity and dams have not yet launched any single construction project of at least a dam to hold some of the water of the Nile for utilization in irrigation scheme. For that reason, our ministries of agriculture are expected to raise the concern of the cultivators of this country by initiating field programmes for them as rains approach. Since the extension service of the ministries of agriculture is related to media because most of their work is imparting of information and enlightenment of the cultivators or farmers on their agricultural endeavours, it is high time to hear what they have in stock for the coming agricultural season. Since the current policy of the Republic of South Sudan is to redress the dependency of food from the neighbouring East African countries by encouraging our own producers to cultivate and harvest our food crops from our own resourceful lands, it becomes very imperative for us to question our ministries of agriculture what programmes they have for the coming season which is very near? In the past years, there used to be too much talk about agriculture in the middle of the seasons when we could not grow urgently needed food crops and attention used to be focused on experimental plantation which could not solve even a portion of the food supply problem. Therefore while the cultivation period is just a few weeks away, it is healthy to begin drawing the attention of our policy makers and implementers as well as those who are aspiring to be our food growers in the next season of cultivation. We need to plan ahead of time so that we can execute our programmes satisfactorily. It is only when we act more than talking of policies that we can score goals in our effort to overcome problems related to food security. Much of South Sudan is a fertile land fit for food growing. If only our people who have some capitals that they can invest in agriculture this is the time for them to think of undertaking such a task. There should not be any problem related to land in the rural areas if those who would like to undertake such agricultural endeavours are from the particular areas because after all the food they will grow will first benefit the immediate people of the area. And only when there is food surplus can it go to the larger commercial centres like the towns. Chiefs in the payams and bomas should encourage their subjects to allow their members who have some cash to invest in short term agriculture so that they can grow enough food for their consumption in the payams, bomas, counties, states and the nation of South Sudan. Let us make it a point this year to try and cultivate enough food crops that will satisfy our immediate requirements. If we succeed to do this then we can say with confidence that our future of food supply looks brighter. We should begin with the area that we can plant with food crops and expand gradually but surely and in years to come we shall find that hunger is a pain of the past which will not repeat itself in South Sudan. But let all those responsible for making policies for agriculture to come out in the field to implement them because the season is at hand to do something according to our respective responsibilities.",POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,hunger,0,0
"The article discusses the outbreak of full-scale warfare in South Sudan, with rebel forces controlling several locations including Jonglei, Bentiu, and Bor. The violence erupted following the firing of Vice President Riek Machar, causing speculation that the President's actions were motivated by ethnic biases. American troops were injured during the conflict and foreign aid workers and embassy staff evacuated as medical facilities become overwhelmed with casualties.","Our nation is now torn by rebellion, in full, senseless assault on our people and our freedom. More than 1,000 are said to have been killed with many injured throughout the country. Medical facilities, where they exist, are overwhelmed with casualties even as foreign aid workers, embassy staff, and volunteers flee for their lives from what is now war-torn South Sudan. Skirmishes that began last week have now exploded into full-scale warfare. Although the worst of the carnage is in Jonglei, and in Unity State where the capitols of Bor and Bentiu are now said to be controlled by insurgents, Juba also finds itself under siege. According to CNN- ""All Americans who presented themselves at the United nations camp in Bor, South Sudan were safely evacuated Sunday the State Department said--"". Four American troops were injured during an earlier failed attempt according to the State Department. The severity of those injuries is unknown at this time. Bor and most of Jonglei fell into control of the insurgents last friday, SPLA spokesman Colonel Philip Aguer stated in response to inquiries. Col. Aguer further acknowledged that Bentiu, capitol of Unity State, is now in the hands of forces loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar. ""Bentiu is in the hands of a commander who has declared support for Machar. Bentiu is not in our hands"". While the whereabouts of Riek Machar are unknown, he is currently rumored to be protected by insurgent forces somewhere in Unity State. At this time he has made no formal statement either acknowledging, or denying any involvement with the insurgent forces. Michael Makuie Lueth, Information Minister for South Sudan stated ""He (Riek Machar) is a rebel. He is a renegade and we are looking for him. He is moving in the bushes of South Sudan."" What began last July with President Salva Kiirs firing of his Vice President, Riek Machar, and the dismissal of his entire cabinet was exacerbated by the lengthy delay in appointing new ministers, leaving the ship of state to appear rudderless. During the ensuing days, speculation enflamed the public sense that the President's agenda was to diminish the influence of the Nuer people while strengthening the authority of his own Dinka nation. Although Riek Machar, himself, acknowledged that the President had the constitutional right to remove him from office, the appearance to a startled nation was that of an elected leader assuming dictatorial powers. On that topic, the former Vice President has maintained a very loud silence. Communication throughout South Sudan has become problematic, and much of what is known derives from witnesses evacuating the districts that are under siege. Papa Maury Clark is a former advisor to the government of South Sudan, retired investment banker/broker, as well as a Called and Commissioned Deacon in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), Northwest Washington Synod. He served under Bishops Appointment as pastor of Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church in Maple Valley, Washington in 1990 and 1991, and also served four years on the Synod Council and he has been deeply involved with the people of South Sudan since 1996.",NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,hunger,-1,-1
"The article discusses the international aid conference hosted by Norway and the United Nations to provide aid for South Sudan to prevent famine and uphold human rights. Over $600 million in aid was pledged, but about $1.26 billion was still needed to meet the total needs of $1.8 billion for this year. South Sudan has been in a crisis due to a deadly conflict forcing more than 800,000 people to flee their homes. The UN and its partners plan to provide food, water, and shelter, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has agreed to help mitigate the crisis by providing emergency employment to affected and displaced people. The article also warns of the likelihood of the situation worsening during the second half of 2014 and states that half of South Sudan's 12 million people will be either in flight, facing starvation, or dead by the end of that year. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of promoting reconciliation and recovery and raising awareness of the underlying causes of the conflict in addition to providing emergency aid.","New York â€” International donors yesterday pledged more than $600 million dollars in aid to South Sudan at a conference hosted by Norway and the United Nations (UN) aimed at preventing famine and upholding human rights in the world's newest country which has been ravaged by months of fighting. ""These generous pledges will, once paid, translate into life-saving relief to the most vulnerable people in South Sudan and to those who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries,"" said Valerie Amos, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, who co-chaired the conference with Norwegian Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende. ""The UN and our humanitarian partners must now do our part and deliver,"" she urged. Before the conference, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said about $1.26 billion was still needed to meet the total needs of $1.8 billion for this year. The additional funding would allow aid groups to provide food, water and shelter. South Sudan has been enmeshed in a crisis which began in mid-December 2013 as a political dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy president, Riek Machar, who had been forced from office earlier that year. The in-fighting has since erupted into a deadly conflict forcing more than 800,000 people to flee their homes. ""The conflict will have long-lasting consequences, rolling back years of development achievements and a hard won peace, increasing poverty, as well as long-term insecurity and vulnerability to future shocks. Said Toby Lanzer, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan in a recent op-ed in the Huffington Post. ""While the needs of people in South Sudan require urgent attention, and continued funding, we must keep in mind that emergency operations can only assist them in the short-term. Because humanitarian action is a palliative, not a long-term solution, it is never too early to promote reconciliation and recovery."" As part of the humanitarian response, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has agreed to help mitigate the crisis by providing emergency employment to affected and displaced people, helping people move home and address the underlying causes of the conflict by helping communities to mediate and settle disputes peacefully. Briefing the Security Council earlier this month, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that by the end of this year, half of South Sudan's 12 million people will be either in flight, facing starvation, or dead. If nothing is done, the number of displaced could rise to 1.5 million. A third of the country's population is severely food insecure. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that there is a high likelihood that the situation could worsen during the second half of 2014. Some 50,000 children are at serious risk of dying of malnutrition, especially those who have been displaced, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) added. Yesterday's conference ""is the last best chance for donors to help aid agencies,"" said Lanzer. The funding is urgently needed before the situation unravels further, OCHA has warned. In conflict-affected states such as Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, the planting season has been disrupted, and people now only have one month left to plant their crops. In addition, in many areas, people are still recovering from the effects of the 2013 floods making them particularly susceptible to famine and malnutrition.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,hunger,0,1
"The article discusses the tens of thousands of civilians fleeing from Duk County in Jonglei, South Sudan due to continued fighting despite a ceasefire agreement. Armed men attacked several villages, leading to the destruction of homes, government buildings, and schools. Both the Sudan People's Liberation Army and anti-government forces deny responsibility for the attacks. Many displaced individuals are hungry and in need of aid, but there is limited availability. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called for $1.27 billion in funds to help those in need in South Sudan, with donors only funding 20% of that amount.","Civilians have fled Duk County in South Sudan's biggest state, Jonglei, by the tens of thousands as fighting continues in the young country five weeks after a ceasefire agreement was signed. Duk County Commissioner Elijah Mocnom, one of the newly displaced from the rural area 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the state capital, Bor, said 60,000 people are ""running"" from violence and enduring deplorable and dangerous conditions as they flee. Mocnom said he had heard reports that towns and villages in the county have continued to empty out since he fled on Tuesday. He said armed men attacked at least three villages, setting homes on fire and destroying government buildings and schools. ""There is no food and there is no medicine, because the clinic of Duk Payuel is already destroyed,"" he said. Army, Rebels Deny Responsibility Spokesmen for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and anti-government forces both denied that fighters from their side were responsible for the attacks. Dau Akoi Jurkuch, the Commissioner of Twic East County, which lies to the south of Duk, said more and more people are arriving fby the day, most of them carrying only the few small items they could scrabble together. Many of the displaced are hungry and in need of aid, but there is little available. The United Nations estimates nearly 900,000 people have been displaced since fighting began in mid-December, including 129,300 in Jonglei state. South Sudan Red Cross Communications Officer Madit Magot said many of those fleeing Jonglei have crossed the White Nile River into Mingkamen in neighboring Lakes State, where more than 70,000 internally dispaced persons have gathered. ""In Bor, here, still there is phobia and these people, when they come, they get nobody inside Bor here. There is nothing that can make them stay,"" he said. Magot said aid agencies are scrambling to provide food, clean water and shelter to the thousands of people who have fled to Mingkamen.

"The article discusses the visit of the United Nations relief chief to areas in Jonglei state, specifically Pibor and Walgak, which were hit by ethnic violence resulting in the displacement of thousands of civilians and loss of property and livelihood. The relief chief expressed concern over the targeting of humanitarian premises and personnel, slowing relief operations, and the worsening humanitarian situation in the country due to food shortages and oil production shutdown. The UN has requested donors to provide over $760 million for humanitarian needs in South Sudan.","The United Nations relief chief today visited areas in South Sudan hit by recent ethnic violence and met some of the victims of a vicious cycle of raids and reprisal attacks, describing what she had seen as ""a terrible situation"" with people having lost loved ones, property and livelihood. ""I am extremely concerned that humanitarian premises were specifically targeted, and we lost critical supplies, which slowed our relief operation,"" said Valerie Amos, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, speaking to reporters after visiting Pibor and Walgak in Jonglei state. ""I urge all parties to respect humanitarian premises and personnel, so that we can help the people of Jonglei,"" she said. Deadly clashes between the Lou Nuer and Murle communities in late December and early January displaced tens of thousands of civilians and prompted UN agencies to launch a major humanitarian operation to assist those in need. ""We are working to meet basic life-saving needs - food, water, medicine, household items. Many of the areas we need to reach are very remote and can only be reached by air, making this operation hugely expensive compared to assistance delivered by road,"" said Ms. Amos, who is also the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator. She emphasized her concern over the humanitarian situation in the country as a whole, saying it remained ""extremely precarious"" and could deteriorate fast, with food shortages having already worsened this year. ""If oil production is shut down, many people will feel the effects - humanitarian needs will inevitably increase, and the combined efforts of the Government, the aid community and the donors will not be enough. The scope of this crisis cannot be ignored,"" she said. Authorities in South Sudan have threatened to shut down oil production because of a lack of progress in talks to resolve a dispute with neighbouring Sudan over revenues and tariffs for the use of Sudan's infrastructure to export the commodity. The UN and humanitarian partners have this year requested donors to provide over $760 million for humanitarian needs in South Sudan. ""But we can only do so much. Government leadership is vital,"" said Ms. Amos. She said the UN appreciated Government leadership in the highly complex return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their villages of origin, but stressed that returns must be voluntary, and conducted in safety and dignity. ""Since my last visit here in 2010, signs of change in South Sudan are already visible, and I can see it here in Juba. But perhaps the most significant change is in the hearts of the people, proud of their hard-won nation, the newest independent country in the world.

He also visited Gambella in Western Ethiopia to see refugees streaming across the border and heard their heartbreaking stories of flight.

"The article discusses the ongoing war in South Sudan that began with fighting in Juba in December 2013. The war has resulted in over 30,000 deaths, mainly civilians. There are nearly one million internally displaced people (IDPs) in South Sudan who lack basic necessities and are residing in UNMISS compounds. In particular, the Nuer IDPs in Juba are living in deplorable conditions after being massacred and facing threats from Dinka soldiers. The article calls for urgent action to relocate the Nuer IDPs to safer places such as Kenya or Ethiopia. The author also criticizes the IGAD intervention militarily and instead calls for increased humanitarian assistance and reinforcement of the UN peacekeeping force to oversee implementation of cessation of hostilities. The author ends by thanking Norway for their continued support of South Sudan.","Dear Your Excellency, I am hereby sending to you this appeal for urgent consideration. Following the abrupt fighting in Juba which took place on the 15th December 2013, within the Presidential Guards at Tiger Barracks which later on ignited the ongoing war between the government of South Sudan and the SPLA - In Opposition under leadership of Dr. Riek Machar, former Vice President of South Sudan and subsequent massacres of over ten thousand Nuer civilians in Juba as from 16th - 19 December 2013, respectively. The three months old war in South Sudan has already caused untold miseries in terms of human and material loses mainly in the four affected states of Central Equatoria, Unity, Jongeli and Upper Nile. Whereasover thirty thousands or more have already perished mostly civilians killed deliverately by the warring parties or died as results of war related diseases. The situation of IDPs in these four states mentioned above is very volatile and unbearable especially to the needy civilians who are displaced from their settlements and sought refuge in government held towns or in the rebels controlled areas. The numbers of IDPs scattered all over South Sudan is getting closer to one million people and are currently bearing the brunt of the war. They are lacking shelters, food, cooking utensils, clothing, sleeping materials etc. The most unfortunate group are the ones still residing in UNMISS compounds in Juba, Bentiu, Bor and Malakal. Their conditions are pathetic and needs urgent action to be taken by international community to avert more catastrophic conditions. The IDPs in Juba alone which numbering forty thousands mainly from Nuer and are leading a destitute and hopeless lives as you can see from the pictures attached below where rains have been pouring on them recently three times consecutively while they lacked all basic human necessities. They are already displaced and deprived from going back to their homes in Juba because the government does not guarantee their security. Those are the remnants of the massacred Nuer civilians who luckily escaped the aftermath onslaughts by the so-called ""Presidential Guards"" of only Dinka recruited soldiers to UNMISS compounds for their protections. The Nuer IDPsin UNMISS camps are extremely afraid and at the same time, unwilling to return back to their homes for fears of being killed by the same Dinka soldiers who are still looking after them. Their condition is very unfortunate and pathetic indeed. As a matter of urgency, as shown on the pictures where the said IDPs are standing in water in UNMISS compounds hopelessly waiting only for ""Good Samaritans"" to come to their rescue by relocating them to saver places for resettlements. The rainy season has already started in Greater Equatoria states and will last up to December 2013. If they are left unattained to most of them particularly children and elderly people will definitely not-withstand such conditions and eventually die of pneumonia and other water-bone related diseases. Dear Your Excellency, in this regard, I am humbly appealing to your esteemed institution to urgently lobby for your western colleagues from European Union, Troika countries of USA, UK and Norway, AU, UN and NGOs agencies operating in South Sudan respectively to urgently relocate the Nuer IDPs in Juba to either Kenya or Ethiopia for resettlements where their children can go to schools and live freely from current captivity where they are in now at UNMISS compounds in Juba. Psychologically, most of the Nuer IDPs at UNMISS centres in Juba, Bentiu and Bor are terribly depressed and in state of despairs from such ordeals that sadly have befallen them in their own country. Hence, the ongoing peace process in Addis Ababa being mediated by IGAD members state will not bear any much fruitful results due to lack of seriousness on the government of South Sudan and the mediators. The Cessation of Hostilitiessigned on 23rd January 2014, by the two parties namely the government of South Sudan and SPLM/A - In Opposition has never been honoured to its logical conclusion by the signatories of the agreement. This is because the demands put forward by the SPLM/A - In Opposition which include the released of four political detainees and immediate withdrawal of UPDF, JEM and SPLA-N forces that have been fighting alongside the government of South Sudan never been implemented as previously agreed upon by the parties and witnessed by principal mediators in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.The Ugandan, JEM and SPLA-N forces invited by the South Sudan government are still operational and being increased in numbers as the situation in the ground is concerned. In addition to that, the IGAD countries have principally agreed to immediately deploy a deterrence force which will be tasked to guard oil installations and government infrastructures while neglecting the issue of IDPs in UNMISS compounds as well as the demands from the rebels side which include the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces invited by the government of South Sudan. The outcome of IGAD heads of state's ""Joint CommuniquÃ©"" of the 13th March, has been categorically rejected by Dr. Riek Machar, leader of SPLM/A - In Opposition simply because his demands have not been implemented by IGAD mediators and instead they want to urgently deploy IGAD deterrence forces from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia. The opposition regards such hastily decision by IGAD countries as declaration of war against them in favour of the incumbent president Salva Kiir Mayardit whose human rights violation record is soared extremely.Their mission to South Sudan will definitely amount to regionlise the conflict whereas some invisible actors shall intervene on either side and this will aggravate more suffering of innocent civilians in the country. It will probably increase the number of death rates and massive displacements among the civilians. What is the use of over twelve thousands UNMISS forces operating in different parts of South Sudan if IGAD could also send an imperial army to side with the government against the SPLM/A - In Opposition? This act of aggression from some IGAD countries is completely a violation of the South Sudanese rights to address their grievances against despotic and tyranny leadership spearheaded by President Salva Kiir Mayardit. The IGAD action would definitely bring South Sudan on the same line with Somalia where Africa Union has a force of more then twenty thousands troops fighting Al Shabab rebellion movement.The root causes of the current conflict must be first and foremost be addressed adequately before rushing on external military option, which will be long and costly in terms of human and materials. The only way to bring about a lasting peace in South Sudan is to avoid sending IGAD forces and only reinforce the UN peacekeeping force to oversee the implementations of cessation of hostilities as well as increasing humanitarian assistance to the affected IDPs in the country. Norway should discourage this decision of IGAD by table it to United Nations Security Council as matter of urgency. Otherwise South Sudan will soon end up like Somalia and even worst as far as the environment and attitudes of South Sudanese people is concerned. They will never succumb to IGAD pressure at all. The rebels will continue with their liberation war until President Kiir relinquishes power to South Sudanese people so that they can decide their own person of choice to lead them during the interim period and not by forced of arms from IGAD countries. In conclusion, I am honestly appealing to Your Excellency once again to take this petition of IDPs relocation seriously as well as the IGAD intervention militarily. These two items are very crucial for you to act upon them. Hence, I am very thankful indeed for your unwavering and steadfast stand in addressing in press releases made by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,about the use of cluster bombs repeatedly by UPDF and SPLA forces in the areas around Bor against both the opposition forces and unarmed civilians which resulted to death of several hundreds lives and call for immediate withdrawal of Uganda troops in South Sudan soil. These are qualities of a leader who valued human dignity and life very much than material gains. I wish you all the best and success in your endeavour efforts to search for peace and harmony in the war ravaged country- South Sudan. May God Almighty help you individually and the country at large. Norway had been investing enormous money in billions of Kroner to assist the needy people in South Sudan right from Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972 era to 21 years of Sudan civil war and CPA and even during this independence time. I really thank you very much for it. As somebody who have lived in Norway for 28 years and been actively involved in South Sudan struggle for quite along time, I really need to thank your country for continued support to my people in South Sudan. Attached herewith are the pictures of the latest rains in Juba which portrayed the exact conditions of the IDPs at UNMISS compounds. I hope you will take this petition seriously and put it into urgent consideration.

"The article discusses the severe malnutrition and starvation crisis in the Nuba Mountains, where the people are resorting to eating insects, weeds, and leaves to survive amid ongoing bombings from the Sudanese government. The international response has been weak, with Sudan's President Omar al Bashir refusing to allow a humanitarian corridor to be established. The article criticizes the lack of action from the Obama administration and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights, Samantha Power, despite her past advocacy for standing up to genocide. The author urges US citizens to demand action from their government to establish a way to get food to the people of the Nuba Mountains.","An untold number of people (certainly thousands and possibly tens of thousands) in the Nuba Mountains are suffering severe malnutrition and many have already begun to perish from starvation. Huddled in mountain caves and crevasses as they seek security from the ongoing bombings from Government of Sudan airplanes, the Nuba Mountains people are resorting to eating insects, weeds, and leaves in a desperate effort to remain alive. The international response to this latest crisis instigated by Sudanese President Omar al Bashir, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for the atrocities perpetrated in Darfur, Sudan, has been anemic. In late January, rumors began circulating that both the United Nations and the United States were discussing the possibility of establishing a humanitarian corridor in order to truck foodstuff to the people in the Nuba Mountains. Purportedly, both the UN and the US approached al Bashir about such a possibility but he categorically refused to allow such a corridor to be established. This is exactly what he did in the early- to mid- 1990s when he, for the first time, purposely withheld food from the Nuba Mountains people, which resulted in genocide by attrition. Very few in the world knew about that tragedy, and as a result al Bashir and his cronies were never held responsible for their murderous actions. In other words, impunity reigned. (Tellingly, not ten years later the Sudanese Government carried out another genocide, this time in western Sudan in a place called Darfur.) And now the nightmare has started all over again in the Nuba Mountains, but this time the tragedy has been well documented from its outset. To allow a dictator, who is an accused genocidare, to dictate to the UN and US what they can and cannot do in regard to saving thousands, or more, from imminent starvation is not only ludicrous, it's unconscionable. The time to halt genocide is before it happens. In other words, when it is evident that crimes against humanity are being perpetrated the international community must staunch them immediately. When such crimes are allowed to fester not only does it result in an ever-increasing number of deaths but it suggests that the killers enjoy impunity. That, obviously, sends the wrong signal to the perpetrators. When not held accountable for their actions some perpetrators are emboldened to kill again and again, all the while believing that no matter what they do they are above the law. Standing by and doing little to nothing in the face of genocide is nothing new to the international community. Indeed, as noted in a book I recently co-edited, Centuries of Genocide: Essays and Eyewitness Accounts (New York: Routledge, 2012), the international community largely stood by and did nothing during the Ottoman Turk genocide of the Armenians (1915-1919), the Nazi extermination of the Jews during the Holocaust, the Khmer Rouge slaughter of its own people in Cambodia (1975-1979), the 1994 Hutu genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, and the 1995 Serb slaughter of Muslim boys and men in Srebrenica. Be that as it may, President Barack Obama promised that his administration would be more proactive in preventing genocide than previous administrations had been. In fact, at a talk this past April at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum during which President Obama announced, and touted, his administration's establishment of the Atrocities Prevention Board, he said: ""Last year in the first ever presidential directive on this challenge, I made it clear that preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America."" And yet, President Obama's Administration has seemingly taken no action other than engaging in a lot of diplomatic jibber jabber. And, as a result, the situation in the Nuba Mountains has slowly but surely morphed, first, from the forced dispersal of the people of the Nuba Mountains as a result of Government of Sudan aerial and ground attacks to malnutrition and, now, from severe malnutrition to starvation or what Yassir Arman, the Secretary General of the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement-North, has recently referred to as ""the imminent starvation of thousands of people in the Nuba Mountains."" What is particularly ironic about the Administration's inaction vis-Ã -vis the imminent starvation in the Nuba Mountains is that Ms. Samantha Power, who, for years, in one magazine article, editorial and speech after another, berated one U.S. presidential administration after another for being weak in the face of genocide, now serves as Obama's Special Assistant and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights and the Chair of the newly minted Atrocities Prevention Board. But, she, like her boss, has largely been silent about the critical need to stanch the incipient starvation in the Nuba Mountains. As far as can be ascertained, she has done little to nothing to urge, prod and cajole Obama to apply sustained pressure on al Bashir to immediately allow for the implementation of a humanitarian corridor from South Sudan to the Nuba Mountains. In a 2001 article entitled ""Bystanders to Genocide,"" which appeared in the Atlantic Magazine, Power asked a series of questions aimed at the administration of Bill Clinton: ""Why did the United States not do more for the Rwandans at the time of the killings? Did the President really not know about the genocide, as his marginalia suggested? Who were the people in his Administration who made the life-and-death decisions that dictated U.S. policy? Why did they decide (or decide not to decide) as they did? Were any voices inside or outside the U.S. government demanding that the United States do more? If so, why weren't they heeded? And most crucial, what could the United States have done to save lives?"" One has to wonder whether Power, who certainly has President Obama's ear, has had the integrity and gumption to posit the same sort of questions to her boss (or, for that matter, herself) vis-Ã -vis the tragedy that has been unfolding in the Nuba Mountains over the past twelve months. Indeed, one has to wonder whether Power is better at criticism and wielding the pen than she is at heeding her own advice. More specifically, back in 2002 while speaking about the need for individuals to stand up and be heard whenever genocide rears its ugly head, she said: ""... Unless regular people and not just human rights people start to identify with upstanders, we'll always be saying 'never again'... Instead of marginalizing upstanders as soft and irrational, we have to send a message that there will be a political price to be paid for looking the other way"" (quoted in Kirst, 2002). Thus far, instead of being an ""upstander"" within the Obama Administration, Power has seemingly been the loyal bureaucrat who does not, for whatever reason, make waves. In her fiery days as an ""upstander"" she would more than likely have deemed such a stance nothing less than ""hypocrisy."" Also in 2002, while speaking to the graduating class at Swarthmore, Power said: ""How many of us do not believe that the presidents, senators, bureaucrats, journalists, and ordinary citizens who did nothing [during the Holocaust years], choosing to look away rather than to face hard choices and wrenching moral dilemmas, were wrong? And how can something so clear in retrospect become so muddled at the time by rationalizations, institutional constraints, and a lack of imagination? How can it be that those who fight on behalf of these principles are the ones deemed unreasonable?"" Again, one has to wonder: has Ms. Power asked herself this very question as she sits in a seat of power in Washington, D.C.? Quite frankly, President Obama and Ms. Power seem little different than the presidents and bureaucrats, respectively, who proceeded them; that is, they, like their predecessors, seem to more readily gravitate to realpolitk than humanitarian action. That said, there are two distinct differences between Obama and Power and their predecessors: first, the former are much more slick in their effort to appear caring (i.e., saying the ""right words"" and establishing this and that job title/position or agency to purportedly fight genocide); and second, they are far more inclined to pat themselves on the back for ostensibly being proactive vis-Ã -vis the prevention of genocide. But, as we all know, actions speak louder than words. For those U.S. citizens who truly care that tens of thousands of innocent men, women, children and infants are facing imminent starvation, it is time to stand up and be counted. And in doing so, it is imperative for them to flood their members of Congress, President Obama, Ms. Power, and Ms. Hilary Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State, with the demand to act now to establish a way to get food to the people of the Nuba Mountains. What we, the people, cannot do, is allow more time to pass without our voices being heard. For as time passes, the people of the Nuba Mountains shall continue to die horrific deaths. Together, we must hold Obama to honor his words and promises, starting with the following utterance he made at the USHMM at the 2012 Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony: ""On this day, and all days, we must do more than remember. We must resolve that 'never again' is more than an empty slogan. As individuals, we must guard against indifference in our hearts and recognize ourselves in our fellow human beings."" Samuel Totten is a genocide scholar based at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Over the past two years has conducted research in the Nuba Mountains.

However, partners urgently require $220 million for critical actions to be taken before the end of the dry season in May, he stressed. Appealing to donors to ""give generously, and to give now,"" to replenish the fund, Mr. Owusu said the additional funding was necessary to combat widespread food insecurity, malnutrition, displacement and disease in the country. This year, about two per cent of the $1.3 billion required to provide life-saving assistance and protection has been received.

"The article discusses the devastating year-long conflict in South Sudan, which has displaced 1.9 million people and caused countless deaths and atrocities. The conflict originated from political in-fighting between the South Sudan President and Vice President. The conflict has made aid delivery immensely difficult, with a total of 13 humanitarian workers having died since November 2013. Despite efforts to assist those affected by the conflict, 2.5 million people will still face food insecurity next year, and aid organizations require $600m to start their 2015 operations. The conflict has also led to many South Sudanese refugees fleeing to neighboring countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, which have struggled to provide sufficient resources to support them.","A year of conflict has ""devastated"" South Sudan, the United Nations Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Kyung-wha Kang, said at UN Headquarters today, as she briefed journalists on her recent visit to that crisis-torn country and to Ethiopia. Ms Kang, who is also UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs said fighting displaced some 1.9 million within the country, with many thousands seeking refuge in UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) bases as they fled attacks in fear for their lives. Many more had fled into the bush and were too fearful to return to their homes. ""Countless people have been killed, some very brutally,"" she said, pointing out that many more had suffered appalling crimes, with many villages torched and lives ruined. Children, like a 13 year-old she recalled meeting in Lankien in Jonglei Province, had lost access to education and she had assessed the work of humanitarians in response to dire needs. Political in-fighting between South Sudan President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, started in mid-December 2013 and subsequently turned into a full-fledged conflict that has sent nearly 100,000 civilians fleeing to UNMISS bases around the country. Ms. Kansa said today that even before the outbreak of hostilities, aid delivery in South Sudan posed major difficulties but the conflict intensified a ""bleak"" situation. Humanitarians faced active hostility, threats to their lives and significant logistical pressures. A total of 13 humanitarian workers had died since November 2013, but their efforts meant that assistance reached 3.5 million people, that a famine was averted, and that a cholera outbreak had been suppressed. Despite such efforts, however, 2.5 million people would face food insecurity next year and aid organizations needed $600m to kick-start their 2015 operations. Pre-positioning of assets and preparations ahead of the rainy season in April would be necessary, as up to 60 per cent of the country's roads would become impassable. In addition, previous dry seasons had seen escalations of violence, and she said she expected the same to happen now. An uptick in violence had already been seen in some provinces. During her visit to Ethiopia, Ms. Kang travelled to the town of Gambella, on the border with South Sudan, where many South Sudanese refugees had fled. Up to 40 per cent of the 472,000 refugees fleeing South Sudan arrived in Ethiopia, she noted, adding that Kenya and Uganda were also major stopping points. She was impressed by the Ethiopian Government's efforts to help refugees and she pointed out that resources required to support the refugee population were increasingly stretched as the needs and scale of requirements grew to ""tremendous"" levels. While in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, she had briefed the African Union Peace and Security Council, noting that her message, first and foremost, was that ""the conflict must stop.""

A consultative meeting between the government and international NGOs on upcoming national reconciliation campaigns (ST) The leadership of the newly born nation is set to initiate an overdue national reconciliation process which was supposed to take place during the six-year interim period between 2005 and 2011. The healing process was stipulated in the 2005 peace deal that ended the war between the former regions of north and south Sudan. However, the two sides concentrated on implementation of other clauses of the agreement, particularly the provision of referendum on self-determination which eventually resulted to the split of the former Sudan into two republics in July 2011. South Sudan's officials say Khartoum showed no interest in the reconciliation process during the six-year interim period partly because the war was still raging on in Darfur. Rocked by a series of intertribal conflicts, armed rebellions, corruption, and other issues of governance and rule of law, the leadership of the new state said it was high time that the people were reconciled in order to achieve peace and security and development. The expected long process was due to kick off on April 18 with a conference to be addressed by the president of the Republic, Salva Kiir Mayardit, which would then be followed by reconciliation campaigns across the country. The organising committee on Saturday however announced that the date to convene the launching conference is rescheduled to 1st June this year in order to give ample time for the committee to make the necessary preparations for the event.

"The article discusses the need for peace in South Sudan, which has been ravaged by war for over a year. The author encourages all South Sudanese to support the peace process and to be patient in negotiations, for the sake of the country's future. The article also discusses the impact of the war on the people of South Sudan and the importance of unity in achieving lasting peace.","Dear South Sudanese people, our peace is with General Salva Kiir Mayardit and Riek Machar. Another day without peace in South Sudan is another day for South Sudanese to mourn for those we've lost and worry for our loved ones who are still in harm's way. The deadline for the agreement has come and gone, and the peace we all have been waiting for was not signed into action. The moment when the peace was not achieved, I felt upset and, and perhaps you did, too. As you all know, this war has robbed us of our country, and it has driven so many of our people into destitution in a country known to be one of the richest in natural resources. With those harsh realities in mind, we cannot be dismissive of the troubles that the war has inflicted on us for over a year now. And so, we must strive to reclaim our rights, but we also must resolve to live in harmony through the peace process. Pursuing peace is the only way to uphold the rights of all people and to bring dignity to the country as a whole. For now, we must only seek consolation for our losses in peace; once we establish a calm environment in our country, prosperity will follow. For those South Sudanese who are asserting their opinions and beliefs with violent words and actions, we urge you to stop imposing your will on all of us, because we have had it. Recently, I have noticed that those people who are not motivated to change the terrible situation in South Sudan are the ones who end up putting everyone at risk; they are content with the status quo, so long as they can benefit from it. Such folks are known for being dogmatic with their naive political opinions, and I personally believe that these unyielding attitudes are the true roadblock to in the improvement of our South Sudanese society today. In this crisis, we must all be humble, understanding, and preach peace. You and I both know that the war made people detestable and corrupt, so we cannot afford that to continue in our new country. Most importantly, if we can ensure peace, then the lives of the most vulnerable will change for the better. I am aware that this war was socially constructed; therefore, the people must bring it down. Both of South Sudan's current leaders have vowed to bring peace to the people. It is important for us to think positively and support that initiative, in order to encourage rational reasoning among the leaders so they can secure lasting peace. We know for sure that spontaneous decisions on the part of the leaders could be counterproductive, which is something we cannot support as a people. Patience will fortify the peace process, so remembered to remain courageous and persuasive in your communities as an endorsement for peace in South Sudan. We all yearn for peace, but we must also understand and accept the fact that the peace process involves intense and lengthy negotiations. Our leaders are not simply handed papers to sign. The war has squandered our nation's wealth, people, and seemingly its future, but our hope remains alive in every effort that tries to prevent further displacement of our people. But peace is the only certain way to relieve our distress and the suffering of our people. War has shaped all of the South Sudanese people, because many of us endured it and members of our families were victims of it. Therefore, it has impacted our attitudes toward everything else, which is, quite frankly, understandable. However, even though war has discouraged us, we still have a shared responsibility to stand up for peace. We the people must be patient, because that is exactly what every negotiation needs--patience and level heads. Give those at the negotiating table room to breathe and function, so they can fairly address our problems. I know for sure that every one of us, regardless of our goals and motives, is proud of what we stand for as South Sudanese people. I can admit to you that I am the proudest of South Sudanese citizens, but I am equally sure that those fighting the government are also very proud citizens of our nation. For example, recently, the government, Dr. Majak, and Gabriel Duop Lam were involved in the released of three individuals netted by the rebels. As leaders, Dr. Majak and Duop Lam's interventions in support of non-violence have revealed to us all that peace has been accepted by the South Sudanese people, regardless of our differences. Majak took the rescue of the three individuals personally, so he played a major role in their release. He didn't have to hold a position in the government or in the opposition to rescue innocent citizens. When he engaged in helping these three gentlemen, it was very crucial moment. I will not forget his commitment to peace, and neither should you. Together, all of us South Sudanese are the backbone of our nation, so we are obligated to support its integrity as we wait for peace to come to our country. If you have lashed out before because you are unsatisfied with the peace process, then now more than ever, it is your duty to cast aside those illegitimate reasons and excuses, and get a grip on what is more important to the overall welfare of our country--peace. I would be dishonest if I said that I was not annoyed after I heard that both General Salva Kiir Mayardit and Riek Machar did not sign the peace agreement, but I realized there have been many peace negotiations in the past that were prolonged far longer than what our people are dealing with at the moment. No one is blameless as the war continues, especially those who have been oddly cheerful in support of further conflict. We must remember that encouraging confrontation may result unpleasant possibilities, such as the loss of a member of your family or mine. Such fatal consequences can have irreversible negative impacts on families and the country at large. We cannot stomach that kind of support of the destruction of villages and families. There are always rounds in establishing peace, and we know that it is a process; it needs time, persistence, and tolerance among ourselves and our leaders. As much as I hate how the violence in South Sudan has made for a treacherous situation, I have the willpower to stomach this peace process. You and I are victims of a war without cause. We can only subdue ourselves in these violent times with thoughts of peace. Remember that hastening the process can result in reoccurring violence, which we do not want, above all else. We have had enough of war, but it continues to dismantle the families that survived the previous civil wars. How long are we going to endure living in a country without peace? What we are doing to ourselves is a type of self-humiliation. The war has raised a substantial number of questions for many of us after we witnessed how many people were killed in grisly fashions in a number of areas in South Sudan. Doesn't that make you worry about the future of our country? I am very troubled by everything war has brought to our people. I worry constantly about what the next warring parties might do, and when their violent actions might mean the loss of members of our families. Over week ago, I was stunned by the presentation given by South Sudanese Foreign Minister, Dr. Barnaba Marial Benjamin. I was so proud of him because of the way he represented our country in the eyes of the international community. I felt that before his speech, the world didn't know us as a new nation or understand our many current problems. Dr. Benjamin's speech convinced me that at least one person was really serious about the way things were going in South Sudan from the perception of outsiders. The international community has been vocally reprimanding our country, and Dr. Benjamin officially told them, ""You are wrong on this one."" Even some factions of rebels have accepted his speech as a good representation of the country if we were not at war. But if you think about it, if it wasn't for war, that speech would have been quite different. Even though a few of the rebels in diaspora were saying jokingly, ""The speech was written by Dr. Riek to make us look great internationally,"" I thank Dr. Marial Benjamin for his wonderful words. He brought the reality of the South Sudanese struggle for peace out of the darkness and into the light. Following his bold example, the rest of the South Sudanese people must also take up the gauntlet and advocate for an end to violence. We must speak up and let General Salva Kiir Mayardit and Dr. Riek Machar know that we are waiting patiently for peace.

The union is under the leadership of Mr. Ayii Duang Ayii.Here I would like to congratulate the leadership of the South Sudan Business Union for their efforts in promotion of South Sudan economy by constructing hotels, health and business centers. The outstanding activity that had made it is the establishment of essential commodities centers in different places in Juba where commodities are sold to the citizens with reasonable prices compared to prices charged by the foreign businessmen and women who do not care about the suffering of the South Sudanese people. In their selling camps, you can by a kilo of sugar at 6 SSP which is sold at 8 SSP in other shop. A big tint of Nido milk is sold at 105 which is sold at 120 or 125 SSP in the shops owned by the strangers. That move is way forward toward reduction of essential commodities prices, in addition to eradication of poverty. Furthermore, their commodities could be trusted in regard of their validity.The aim of this article is to encourage the members of this union and appeal to our national and state governments to empower them for more achievements. The citizens of this country are advised to shop in our union camps which are available anywhere in Juba and to save for their families.Finally, the union is encouraged to establish more shops in states and to engage in other businesses such as farming, health and education.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,economy,0,1
"The article discusses South Sudan's recent membership in the African Development Bank (AfDB), its potential for tapping into AfDB financing for national development, and concerns about how it will cover for the loss of oil exports that form 90% of the nation's GDP. The AfDB, established in 1964, is a development financing agency that has financed over 2,800 projects in Africa, largely in infrastructure, and has 79 shareholders, including 26 non-African countries.","The newly independent state of South Sudan has joined the African Development Bank (AfDB), the continent's flagship development financing agency, as its 79th shareholder, after the board of directors of the Bank approved its application last week, at an annual meeting held in Arusha, Tanzania's safari town. Established in September 1964, a year after the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was formed in Addis Ababa, AfDB came into existence after 23 founding shareholders, including Ethiopia, signed the treaty in the aftermath of the end of the colonial era in Africa. Originally an exclusive club for African nations, AfDB opened its doors to countries off of the continent in 1982. Today, there are 26 non-African countries that are shareholders, including the United States, China, and major European countries. Over the past four decades, the Bank has financed 2,885 projects in Africa, largely in infrastructure, spending over 48 billion dollars. South Sudan, whose membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was signed in April 2012, hopes to tap part of this financing available for national development. Tanzania, which hosted the annual meeting of shareholders for the first time last week, is one of the largest borrowers, with Ethiopia sometimes leading with a half a billion-dollar annual portfolio. Both countries benefit from lending furnished through the African Development Fund (ADF), almost with no interest. ""The AfDB provides loans to middle-income countries in Africa, mostly in the north, and finance development projects in poor countries south of the Sahara,"" said a senior expert working for the Bank, headquartered in Tunis. Delegates of South Sudan, led by Mary Y. Jervase, deputy minister of Finance & Economic Planning, were roaming the corridors at the AfDB Group's annual meeting held inside the Arusha Conference Centre, from May 31 to June 1, 2012. They have yet to enjoy the right to vote, for the South Sudan Parliament has to approve the agreement signed by the membership, according to Philip A. Balder, director general for Macroeconomic Planning at the Ministry. ""We feel great, for we have been recognised,"" Jervase told Fortune. ""We are part of the world, and they (the board of directors) saw that we deserved it. It gives us confidence."" Coming out of a destructive civil war of five decades, South Sudan joins the AfDB Group with zero debt. However, the time of its membership in a development finance agency is marked by the backdrop of its political deadlock with Sudan to its north, where the South's shutdown oil pipes lead to Port Sudan, without first finding an alternative way to sell its natural wealth. ""We have actually considered the impact of the decision to shut the pipeline off,"" Jervase told a panel called to discuss peace and state building processes in South Sudan and Somalia. ""We are prepared to fill the gap in revenues."" However, many observers of South Sudan question how its officials are planning to cover for the loss of oil exports, which form 90pc of the nation's GDP. In fact, there are those in the South Sudan government who see membership in the AfDB Group and the Bretton Woods Institutions as part of the plan in searching for an alternative way of finding finances.",POSITIVE,POSITIVE,economy,0,0

The Fund has disbursed about $505 million (against $541 million committed), supporting 20 projects in ten sectors considered vital to South Sudan. As of this writing, South Sudan is a member of five institutions - IBRD, IFC, IDA, ICSID, and MIGA. ","Washington, DC â€” The Republic of South Sudan became the newest member of the World Bank Group today when South Sudan's Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Kosti Manibe Ngai, signed the Articles of Agreement and Conventions of the World Bank Group in Washington DC. In addition to becoming a member of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), South Sudan joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC), International Development Association (IDA), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). IDA is the Bank Group's concessional financing facility that helps the world's poorest countries. South Sudan became the world's newest country on July 9, 2011, after decades of conflict. It has some of the lowest education, health, and other human development results in the world, and more than half of the population lives below the poverty line. The country however has rich agricultural and forestry potential, and significant oil reserves. As a member of IDA, South Sudan will have access to highly concessional resources, in addition to a wide range of technical and advisory services from the World Bank Group. With the admission of South Sudan, membership now stands at 188 countries for IBRD, 184 for IFC, 172 for IDA, 148 for ICSID, and 176 for MIGA.

""South Sudan is a test case for the ideas in our 2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security and Development, emphasizing the leadership role of citizens in their own country- led peace and state-building solutions, with the support of their international development partners. The World Bank is strongly committed to this approach in South Sudan, and also to support the fight against corruption, to promote accountability and good governance, and to work closely with South Sudan and its communities for better social and economic development."" The World Bank Group has been actively engaged in South Sudan's development since 2005, both through analytical work and as the administrator of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS), which is funded by 13 donors and the World Bank. To date, the MDTF-SS has disbursed about $505 million (against $541 million committed), supporting 20 projects in ten sectors considered vital to South Sudan. ""Even before we became members, the World Bank has already been collaborating closely with us. So today we are very pleased that the formalities have finally been completed, and we look forward to a long term partnership with the World Bank Group as we work together on the much needed development of South Sudan,"" said Minister Kosti Ngai. Slightly larger than the size of France, South Sudan has few roads or water infrastructure, while key education and health indicators such as child and maternal mortality and primary enrolment are among the worst in the world. Over the last several years, the MDTF-SS has helped fund the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and maintenance of nearly 3,700 kilometers of all-weather roads, thereby increasing access within the country. Over 1,100 boreholes have been drilled or rehabilitated, and fourteen water distribution systems constructed, thus giving more than 562,000 people across almost 100,000 households in rural South Sudan access to clean and safe water. In addition, the MDTF-SS funded the construction of 46 primary schools and 11 county education centers, trained more than 1,200 new teachers, and enabled the printing and distribution of more than 3.6 million textbooks and teachers' guides throughout the ten states. In the area of health, the MDTF-SS provided for the rehabilitation of 71 health facilities, and enabled the distribution of more than 250,000 malaria kits, 1 million mosquito nets, and 10 million water purification tablets. The rehabilitation of 47 buildings at the Juba Teaching hospital, the largest such medical facility in South Sudan, also means it is now better equipped to serve approximately 100,000 patients a year. In the agriculture sector, advisory services and grants for production inputs have been provided to more than 116,000 farmers across 27 counties in South Sudan. This has helped to increase yields of staple crops by over 30 percent, translating into improved household food security and incomes for those beneficiaries that have been able to produce a surplus. Ahead of South Sudan's independence last July, a $75 million South Sudan Transition Trust Fund (SSTTF) was established by the World Bank to help provide health care, infrastructure, and employment for the people of South Sudan during this transition period.

The country will need to develop strong institutions to guide its monetary and fiscal policies and will be required to run its own fiscal and monetary policy, set up a central bank and adopt its currency and exchange rates.","South Sudan faces a slew of economic challenges that could make or break Africa's newest State, the World Bank has said. Starting on a clean slate, the country's government will be required to put in place institutions to guide its monetary and fiscal policies. As a result, this might delay the take-off envisaged by its optimistic citizens as they celebrate independence on Saturday. ""We are conscious of the numerous challenges that the new country will face going forward and they must develop strong institutions to guide them,"" Mr Ian Bannon, the acting World Bank country director for Sudan, told journalists in Nairobi on Wednesday. Mr Bannon said the institution had set up a $75 million trust fund to be administered around health care, infrastructure and employment. ""This fund will be made available to South Sudan in the first few months after independence,"" explained Mr Bannon. The country has applied for membership to the bank and this is expected to be ratified in about six months. Once ratified, the country will be eligible for additional funding and support from the bank and its agencies. Over the years, South Sudan has relied on policies anchored from the North and donor aid to put it on course to dependence. This has left it with little or no expertise in managing revenues and drawing effective spending plans. After a referendum in January, the country officially seceded from the North. Since then, the South has been concentrating on reconstruction, with the support of several donors. However, with independence, the country will be required to run its own fiscal and monetary policy. This will see it set up a central bank and adopt its currency and exchange rates. ""Since the country will have oil, revenue will not be a problem to them. Putting in place structures of spending it and ensuring public participation in key decision making is vital,"" noted Mr Bannon.

"The article discusses how ongoing conflict in South Sudan may cause parts of the country to fall into famine in early 2015. Aid agencies are calling for diplomatic efforts to end the fighting and for an increase in aid efforts, which need to be improved in terms of quality and delivery.","A group of leading aid agencies warned today that parts of South Sudan - already the world's worse food crisis - could fall into famine early next year if the nine-month long conflict escalates as expected. The agencies fear that efforts this year to prevent the crisis from deteriorating will falter as rival sides are regrouping ready to resume violence once the rainy seasons ends this month. The number of people facing dangerous levels of hunger is expected to increase by 1 million between January and March next year. In a report launched today, ""From Crisis to Catastrophe"", the aid agencies called for neighboring governments and the wider international community to redouble diplomatic efforts to put real pressure on the parties to the conflict to end the fighting, including an arms embargo. They said so far the international community's 'softly-softly' approach to the peace talks has failed to secure a meaningful cease-fire. They also added that there needs to be an increase in both the quantity and quality of the aid effort. Man-made crisis Tariq Reibl head of Oxfam programme in South Sudan said: ""If famine comes to South Sudan it will come through the barrel of a gun. This is a man-made crisis not one caused by the vagaries of the weather and though humanitarian aid is vital it cannot fix a political problem. The international community is much better at saving lives than it is at helping solve the political problems that put lives in peril. Nine months of the softly-softly approach to peace negotiations has failed. If the international community really wants to avert a famine then it has to make bold diplomatic efforts to bring both sides to end the fighting."" The aid agencies said that a mixture of significant aid, a lull in the fighting due to the wet season and the ability of the South Sudanese to cope with hardship, has managed to stave off a famine for the moment. However they warned that now that the wet season is over, an upsurge in fighting is likely, setting back any gains made in the last few months and potentially pushing areas into famine by March 2015. Since the current round of conflict began in South Sudan in December 2013, the country has been pushed to the brink of disaster. However the international aid effort has saved thousands of lives, much of it generously funded by the US, the UK and the EU who have given 60 per cent of the total funding. The UN Mission in South Sudan has opened its compounds to around 100,000 civilians, saving them from ethnic violence, and peace negotiations led by South Sudan's neighbours have come close to brokering a deal. Looking back over 2014, Aimee Ansari head of CARE in South Sudan said: ""South Sudan only just missed falling into famine this year. Partly this was due to the aid effort but much of it is due to the strength, resilience and generosity of the South Sudanese people themselves. ""But they are now at the end of their tether. You can only sell all your livestock once. Eating seeds meant for planning keeps the gnawing hunger away for the moment, but it is mortgaging the future to meet the desperate needs of the present. The people of South Sudan did what they could to survive this year - but that means they will be vulnerable next year. They need to see an end to the fighting so normal life can resume."" Many of the 1.4 million people displaced from their homes are facing an uncertain future. The fighting has disrupted markets and pushed up food prices. Fishermen have been barred from rivers, cattle herders have had their cattle stolen, or been forced to sell them off cheaply. The expected upsurge in fighting once the rains have ended in October will tip many over the edge. More funds are needed The aid agencies called for donor governments to fully support the UN's appeals for humanitarian work in South Sudan and the refugee crisis in neighbouring countries. They also said that the quality of aid needs to be improved. It needs to be delivered where people are rather than where it is easier to reach. And it needs to build on the way people cope with the crisis and to enable them to face any future crisis better prepared. The aid agencies also called on all the government of South Sudan, the opposition and other armed groups to immediately stop fighting and work towards a long-term, sustainable peace deal. All their forces need to stop attacks against civilians, end the use of child soldiers and allow humanitarian workers safe access to people needing their help.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,agriculture,-1,-1

The campaign's launch was attended by officials and nearly 1,000 pupils, including girls from Dare Primary School.","Bentiu â€” Health officials in South Sudan's Unity state have launched a campaign to encourage women to adopt better breast feeding habits for the benefit of their children.

Michael Guo Puot, a nutrition programme manager at Unity state's health ministry, said the objective of the week is to inform mothers who are unaware of good child breastfeeding behaviour. He urged parents, especially mothers, to avoid giving some types of food to babies before they reach six months old. Over seven days seven days will visit schools across Unity state to hold discussions, involving both sexes, to brainstorm how good breastfeeding practices can be passed on to mothers. Children under six months old should be given water and some other foods, Puot said. Failure to breastfeed properly results in malnourishment of children in many communities in South Sudan. A mother and her children wait to see a doctor at Bentiu hospital, 31 August 2013 (ST) Angelina Nyaruac Chan, the director of the Western Upper Nile Women's Working Group, who participated in the campaign launch, urged mothers to be cautious when breastfeeding. ""Women; avoid poor sanitation, you have to feed very well in order for [the heath] of our children. A mother should eat three times in a day; this will make her produce a lot of milk for the baby to grow well"", added Chan. Chan called on mothers to extend the message to other parents who not get access to the information of breastfeeding policy for children safety. Although the programme is due to target both mothers in urban and rural areas, poor roads will hamper the movement of the campaigners.

"The article discusses South Sudan's dependency on foreign food supply despite having fertile and virgin arable lands. Certain states such as Northern Bahr Ghazal, Warrap, Lakes, Unity, and Jonglei have been reverting to the international community for food relief every year. The heavy dependency on the Oil-driven economy and the closure of the northern borders have contributed to the food crisis. The article highlights the need for self-sufficiency and the importance of good governance and accountability, especially in the management of public funds. The decision to shut down Oil production is viewed as an opportunity for South Sudan to prove that it can turn problems into success stories and become self-reliant.","While the world remains fascinated about South Sudan's vast fertile and virgin arable land, the situation on the ground at its best remains a one of total dependency on foreign food supply. This unfortunate trend of events becomes even more worrying when one looks at the year in and year out records of certain states e.g. Northern Bahr Ghazal, Warrap, Lakes, Unity and Jonglei where no single year has passed without the authorities reverting to the international community for food relief in spite of the abundant thousands of dissolute farming lands and water. Whatever reasons are given be them the closure of the northern borders, the constant intertribal fights, or the cattle raiding, yet the truth of the matter is that the local population in most of these areas have lost the motivation to farm the land. This too have been consolidated by the heavy dependency on the Oil driven economy which the SPLM led government inherited with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), but however failed to manage properly. Our citizens in the so-called states with the severest food shortages should understand that if the shutdown of the Oil industry which is aimed at liberating the South Sudan's economy from the grips of the Khartoum based 'Jallaba' regime restores self dignity and protects the nation's sovereignty, the constant appeal for foreign food aid on the other hand reverses all that claim. And truly indeed the habit of constantly begging the International community for Food Aid has for all practical purposes gone too far given the fact that the real war was ended 7 years ago. Of course there are those who would want to blame the current ""home-made"" insecurity for the ghost of famine that remains hanging over most of the villages that have lately witnessed a break-down in law enforcement, it shouldn't be forgotten that whatever was inflicted there was carried out in all cases by local South Sudanese youth regardless of their ethnicities. Could it not be argued that if this very youth were to refrain from terrorising their countrymen and rather engage in food production, the story would have been totally different?You can't eat your cake and still have it: As a people we need to look back and see how far we have come from the days of the rudimentary Regional Government of the Addis Ababa Agreement to today in an independent Republic of South Sudan [RSS]. We fought for independence and an end to servitude and second class status, and here still we aren't ashamed of ourselves when we as an independent nation continue to shout aloud, begging for foreign food aid. Our politicians have often talked about a certain blessing in disguise that would come with the abrupt shutdown in Oil production, however in reality they should have long anticipated all these given the time tested history of our struggle against exploitation and foreign domination. Khartoum chose to close its borders with us thus obstructing any border trading between the two countries and one sees nothing strange in that given the ""Jallaba"" mentality. This might even go on for decades to come or forever. What should have worried us is the defeated so-called Confederal arrangement that would have still given them (Jallaba) the free hand to manipulate and dominate our economy. As for the disputes over the pipelines and the Oil transit fees, these are but a continuation of the unfinished liberation struggle, for otherwise how on earth were we prepared to go on 'dining' with a regime that's stained up to the elbow with the blood of our loved ones? Wasn't it South Sudan's free will when our people overwhelmingly voted by 98.8% in rejection of the Khartoum (mis)rule? That far the game was over, ones and for all, and any turning back to Khartoum would be like going back to Sodom and Gomorrah in days of Lot and his tribesmen. My advice to fellow South Sudanese who live along the northern borders and still want to enjoy a meal of ""Kisra"" and ""Weika"" - (flat pan-bread and dried Okra soup) don't necessarily have to import it from across the border. You are better off growing your own field of okra in your independent backyard this time around. This is what independence from Khartoum translates into at its most basic level. You risk being laughed at if you still yearn for food to come from a quarrelsome neighbour who in fact is a sworn in enemy. Thank God that South Sudan hasn't reached the stage of Somalia yet and for this fact there is every reason for our people to work hard and avoid slipping that way. The youth in Jonglei, Lakes state, Warrap or Unity state should understand that they are better off with hoes, ploughs, machetes and axes farming the vast virgin land of their ancestors which has now been finally liberated by expensive blood, than rooming about with AK -47s and engaging in cattle rustling. To our youth and the political leadership alike, I say this, ""You don't liberate a country and then become thieves in it, but you rather strive to build it and develop it"". Although both politically and socio-economically the Oil remains a negotiating force for South Sudan as it works to balance the development equation, things won't be the same again a situation likely to persist for a decade or more to come. The government will undoubtedly seek to find alternative sources of revenues; otherwise it risks loosing the social contract with the people. But the major concerns however remain and it is how the so-called alternative resources and the funds thus generated are managed. Austerity measures under a leadership that categorically operated on an open ended budget, resisted auditing its books and a tradition allows for its cronies to embezzle public funds with impunity, is in fact a mockery and a self pity for what it claims to stand for. It cannot be overemphasised that a trustworthy leadership, a truly accountable and transparent government and the rule of law are all crucial to the success of any economy that plans to implement austerity measures. These are undoubtedly in shortcoming under the current one man rule and his rubber stamp parliament. President Salva Kiir will have to stop his overused political rhetoric and it is needless here to stress ( to him) the importance as well as the urgency of recovering all the embezzled public funds as it becomes all the crucial, first for his government's credibility in not only the eyes of the general population who are about to experience a tough time ahead as a consequence of the new developments, but also for his credibility with the others in the international fora and the equally important need for South Sudan's survival as a coherent nation at this particular time. Let no one make the mistake to think that all these monetary scandals committed under Salva Kiir's leadership which currently stand in billions of dollars can just die like that unaccounted for or at the least unrecovered. It is time that the so-called leaders understand that no foreign loans will be easy coming if the government of the day do not deliver on its promises to up-root the endemic corruption both in the government and the ruling SPLM party. Without first settling this stigma of a system that loot at will and with impunity, South Sudan's future remains for all practical purposes remain gloomy! The crucial massage that obviously matters the most, is for our people, rulers and subjects alike, that they must be ready to face a new dispensation. The decision to shut-down the Oil production could be easily considered as ""ridiculous"" by the international community if the government just turn around and begins to beg food for its starving citizens or any other basic services for that matter. A very poor country like South Sudan, but lucky to have been blessed with a vast Oil reserve, when it is known to have mismanaged a not less than $20 billion of the Oil revenue, and suddenly now for whatever reason shuts down its Oil production [98% of its total revenues] isn't the ideal candidate that monetary institutions would happily lend their money to and obviously not when the whole world is going bankrupt. So if we rightly think that the shutdown of Oil production was a blessing in disguise, then we have to prove that first to ourselves and then to the world that we are capable of turning problems into success stories without having to criss-cross the world with empty bowls in our hands.",NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,agriculture,0,1
